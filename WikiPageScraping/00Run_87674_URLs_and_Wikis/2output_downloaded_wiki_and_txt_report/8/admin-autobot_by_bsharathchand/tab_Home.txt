<p>###What is it
It is a simple and configurable solution for executing Shell commands on [Unix|Linux] boxes, in a fixed schedule. This helps in executing a set of conditions on a group of servers. It uses existing SSH library <a href="http://www.ganymed.ethz.ch/ssh2/" rel="nofollow">Ganymed SSH2 for Java</a> by <a href="https://www.ethz.ch/de.html" rel="nofollow">ETH Zurich</a> for connecting to these boxes.</p>
<p>###What it does</p>
<ul>
<li>Disk usage monitoring</li>
<li>Processor usage monitoring</li>
<li>Process monitoring</li>
<li>Log Monitoring</li>
<li>anything You can think of...</li>
</ul>
<p>###How it reports
It logs all the console output from all these servers in a temporary log file, along with the timestamp of execution of those commands on these servers. Either you can use this temporary log file for creating your own reports; or use the helper reporting module, and customize reports.</p>
<p>###What next
You can either check our <a href="wiki/../Usage-Guide">usage guide</a> for configuring and using this service as an end user or check our <a href="wiki/../Developer-Guide">developer guide</a> for understanding on customizing the logging and reporting modules for fit your needs.</p>
