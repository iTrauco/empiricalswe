<p>Our IRC channel (#multiverse on Esper.net) Is a great place to go for help. We have a lot of dedicated users who hang out there. However know these things before entering:</p>
<ol>
<li>Rule #1: <strong>Be Polite and Patient</strong>. Talking with experienced users is a privilege not a right. If you're rude, ignore advice, a dick, mean or just plain unpleasant, you will be kicked.</li>
<li>We all have lives and when you arrive, <strong>someone may not answer you right away</strong>. Hang around. Someone will help out.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>If it has been a while (1 hours+) feel free to ask your question again.</li>
<li>If no one answers still, it may be best to come back later.</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>In IRC we like to communicate as quickly as possible to help out as many people as we can. When you enter, <strong>simply ask your question</strong>. No need for "Hi, can anyone help me?"</li>
<li>If you spam the channel you will be kicked. If you do it again, you will be banned. Simple.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here is a log that we dug up from when no one was around. If you want to get help, don't do this. If I had been around, these would be my responses:</p>
<pre lang="none"><code>3:40 AM Would anyone care to lend a hand? &lt;-- Violate #2 above
3:42 AM hello? I need some help? &lt;-- Violate #2 again
3:42 AM no? &lt;-- Don't do this. This makes you look like an impatient 7 year old.
3:43 AM Do any of you give a **** about your plugin?
^^^^^ Yep. We sure do. However, talking like this makes us not want to help you at all. 
^^^^^ If you say this, you're better off leaving the channel and coming back with a different nickname.
3:44 AM HELLO!?! &lt;-- This does not make you louder to us. Just more annoying.
3:44 AM !seen EvilSeph &lt;-- ???
3:44 AM hellp? &lt;-- Still polling for people
3:45 AM hello* &lt;-- More...
3:45 AM ****** hell &lt;-- Profanity makes you look like a dick, as stated earlier.
3:48 AM ok, I'll ask a question and I would like it if someone replies &lt;-- Cool, now we're getting somewhere
3:48 AM how do you change the names of worlds? &lt;-- Awesome. But by now, no one wants to help you.
^^^^^ You've already shown that you're immature and impatient.
