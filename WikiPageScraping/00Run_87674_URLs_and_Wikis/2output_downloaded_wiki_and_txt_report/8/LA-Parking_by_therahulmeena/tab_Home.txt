<p>In order to keep count of no of vehicles parked, opnexc platform is used to know whether a driver has parked his vehicle in the compound of a parking lot when the ignition status is turned to OFF from RUN/ON.</p>
<p>Case Scenario -</p>
<p>A driver comes out of his home to get in the car.</p>
<p>( Initially Vehicle is not parked in a parking lot)</p>
<p>State 1: Driver Car Door Open ( Getting In) State 2: Driver Puts ON the Ignition and then RUNS it.</p>
<p>State 3: Driver reaches the destination. Puts OFF the ignition and come out of the vehicle by Driver Door.</p>
<p>App checks the location of car if it falls inside a parking compound of that area - If it does then , Mark this vehicle as parked and update the information of space available on the server. State 4: Vehicle is parked.</p>
<p>State 5: Driver returns an opens the Drive Door. At this moment the app notifies all the other drivers/users who have subscribed to this Parking Lot that a driver is about to leave this parking lot.</p>
<p>State 6: Driver put ON the ignition and RUN it. On RUN the subscribed users are notified that the driver has left the parking lot just now.</p>
