<p>##User Manual</p>
<p>###User Login/Registration
Entering a username and password into the form at the top of the page allows you to log into an account. If the information is incorrect, an error informing you will pop up.</p>
<p>The main page consists of a registration form. Entering data into it will allow you to register for an account. If there are any errors (eg. That username already exists), a message will inform you of them. If successful, you can return to the main screen and proceed to log in.</p>
<p>###Logged in
All actions the you can do are on the right side of the screen. Search is on the top of the page.</p>
<p>###Groups
You can join a group by entering in the group name and clicking “Join”</p>
<p>You can create a group by entering in the group name and clicking “Create”. You automatically join any group you create.</p>
<p>###Display
Once logged in, the top 5-6 images are shown on the front page that you have access to (the ones that are public or belong to a group you are part of). The rest of the images are show under the top 5-6. They are shown as a thumbnail. Clicking on one will show you the full size image as well as any information about the image. If you want to view more than 5-6 ranked images, use the search function.</p>
<p>###Uploading/Security
There are two options. You can either upload a single image or multiple images. Uploading multiple images at once requires Google Chrome. Once images are selected and the button clicked, the image is successfully uploaded and you are taken to a page where you can set specific information for the images you uploaded. You can set the subject, description, which group it belongs to (by entering in the group ID), and the date uploaded. Clicking the button at the bottom then saves the changes you made to the image.</p>
<p>Groups are assigned by entering in an ID. Public indicates that it can be viewed by everyone, private indicates it can only be viewed by you, and other groups indicate that it can be viewed only by people part of that group.</p>
<p>If you wish to edit uploaded pictures, you can do that by clicking on the “Open My Pictures” button on the right sidebar.</p>
<p>###Search
The search form at the top searches through all images. The two fields on the left are date fields, indicating what range of dates you want to search through. The main field is a subject keyword search. Entering in multiple keywords (separated by a space) consists of an AND search. Example: searching for “a b” will find all images that contain both a and b. Search results are sorted by a rough popularity algorithm.</p>
<p>Pictures are displayed the same way as described under Display.</p>
<p>###Data Analysis
If you are the user ‘Admin’ you can request an OLAP report by entering in the specific data in the OLAP form. Date range as well as frequency are all options.</p>
