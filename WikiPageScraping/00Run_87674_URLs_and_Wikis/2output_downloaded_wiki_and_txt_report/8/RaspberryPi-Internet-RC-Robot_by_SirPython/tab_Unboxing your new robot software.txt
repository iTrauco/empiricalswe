<a href="https://github.com/SirPython/RaspberryPi-Internet-RC-Robot/archive/master.zip">RasberryPi-Internet-RC-Robot.zip</a></p>
<p>After you have that in a place where you are ready to work, proceed.</p>
<ol>
<li>Unzip the folder using your preferred unzipping software.</li>
<li>Plug in a USB drive to your computer</li>
<li>From the unzipped folder, move the "code" folder to the USB drive</li>
<li>Eject the USB drive</li>
<li>Boot up your RPi</li>
<li>Plug your USB drive in</li>
<li>Move the code folder out and put it in a place to your liking.</li>
</ol>
<p>And that's all to it! Proceed to other sections of the wiki to get the server and robot set up and ready for use.</p>
