          <p><em>Disclaimer: This page will not teach you how to set up PHP, it will teach you how to set up PHP so the shell script provided can run. Although this section is teaching you how to set up for use with the shell script, YOU STILL NEED PHP for some server-side scripts to run</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>#Windows:</p>
<ol>
<li>On your desktop, create a new file and name it "php_startserver.bat"</li>
<li>Keeping Notepad open, open the "webpage" directory in the repo.</li>
<li>Open the "php_startserver.sh" file in notepad</li>
<li>Copy over the code from the .sh file to the .bat file</li>
<li>Save the .bat file</li>
<li>Move the .bat file to the same directory as the .sh file</li>
<li>Delete the .sh file</li>
</ol>
<p><em>NOTE: For this to work, you have to make sure that you can access the php executable without having to go to that directory first(it's something about setting macros. Look it up).</em></p>
<hr/>
<p>#Unix</p>
<p>You don't have to do as much. Read the "<em>NOTE</em>" in the "Windows" section - this may apply to you.</p>
<p>To run the shell script, open a terminal session in the "webpage" directory of the repo and type:
<code>sh php_startserver</code></p>
<hr/>
<p>#Mac</p>
<p>I don't know, honestly. Try what is says for the Unix section.</p>
