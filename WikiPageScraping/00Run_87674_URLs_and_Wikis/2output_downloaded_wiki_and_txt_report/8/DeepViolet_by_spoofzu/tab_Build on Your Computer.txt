          <p><strong>To Build DeepViolet Project from Source Using Maven</strong></p>
<pre><code>mvn clean 
mvn compile assembly:assembly -DdescriptorId=jar-with-dependencies
</code></pre>
<p>The output of the build process are two DeepViolet API JAR files.  DeepViolet-*-SNAPSHOT.jar is a binary containing only the DeepViolet project binary distribution.  DeepViolet-*-dependencies.jar includes the project binary distribution as well as the DeepViolet project dependencies(e.g., logback).  Choose the best binary distribution your project or DeepViolet-*-dependencies.jar if you are not sure where to begin.  If you only wish to build the project with no dependencies then, <code>mvn clean ; mvn install</code> is acceptable.</p>
<strong>To Build DeepViolet JavaDocs from Source</strong>
<pre><code>mvn javadoc:javadoc
</code></pre>
<p>Unless you change the default location the output of the JavaDoc build process is located within your project folder, <code>&lt;project target&gt;/sites/apidocs/</code></p>
