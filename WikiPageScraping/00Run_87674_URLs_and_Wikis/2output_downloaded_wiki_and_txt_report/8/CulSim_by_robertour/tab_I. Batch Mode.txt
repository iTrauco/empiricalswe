          <p>The Batch Mode and the <a href="./J.-Command-Line-Interface">Command Line Interface</a> are useful to run repetitions of interesting observations of particular simulation configurations that need to be further explored. The <a href="https://github.com/robertour/CulSim/wiki/H.-Output-Files">output files</a> of the repetitions from this method can be analyzed with any statistical tool that reads csv.</p>
<p>As opposed to the <a href="https://github.com/robertour/cultural-simulations/wiki/J.-Command-Line-Interface">Command Line Interface</a>, the Batch Mode offers a graphical user interface to easily run the experiments. In order to access the Batch Mode, you click on <code>Simulation -&gt; Batch Mode</code>. There are two general tests that can be performed in Batch Mode:</p>

Testing convergence states of simulations (From <a href="https://github.com/robertour/cultural-simulations/wiki/B.-Initial-Parameters">Configuration Files</a>):</h5>
<p>Which is the ("average") final state (measured in any <a href="https://github.com/robertour/CulSim/wiki/F.-Response-variables">response variable</a> , e.g. <strong>cultures</strong>, i.e. cultural diversity) that is produced given one or several <a href="https://github.com/robertour/CulSim/wiki/B.-Initial-Parameters">initial configurations of the simulation</a>? The first tab (From Configuration Files) of the Batch Mode provides this functionality.</p>
<p><img alt="From Configuration Files (Batch Mode)" src="./img/BatchMode-ConfFiles.png"/></p>
<p>All you need to do is add the configuration files that you want to test with the Add Files button <img alt="Add File" src="./icons/document-open-data.png"/>.</p>
<p>You should then decide on the number of times you want to repeat the simulation with the Repetitions selector. To be sure, each repetition will initialize the simulation from scratch (e.g. it will randomly choose new initial cultural traits). Once this is ready, you can start the simulation <img alt="Play Button" src="./icons/media-playback-start.png"/>. This does not resume from the stored state, however, the states of the simulations are stored in the <a href="https://github.com/robertour/CulSim/wiki/H.-Output-Files">simulations folder</a>. If you wish, you can resume these states by indicating the corresponding Results Folder in the From Results Folder tab.</p>

Testing the effect of an event in simulation sets (From <a href="https://github.com/robertour/CulSim/wiki/H.-Output-Files">Results Folder</a>):</h5>
<p>Let's assume that you would like to test the effect (measured in any <a href="https://github.com/robertour/cultural-simulations/wiki/F.-Response-variables">response variable</a>, e.g. <strong>traits similarity</strong>) of a <a href="https://github.com/robertour/cultural-simulations/wiki/D.-Events">simple or composed event</a> in the set of simulation states generated in the previous state. The second tab (From Results Folder) of the Batch Mode provides this functionality.</p>
<p><img alt="From Results Folder (Batch Mode)" src="./img/BatchMode-ResultFolder.png"/></p>
<p>The input will be a <a href="./icons/document-open-folder.png">result folder</a>. Usually the selected folder will be the one generated with the first tab (From Configuration Files). This results folder contains the final states of the simulations that will be tested against a particular singular or composed [event] that was previously stored in the main interface (See <a href="https://github.com/robertour/cultural-simulations/wiki/D.-Events">4. Events</a>).</p>
<p>In order to select the events, you load the saved file with the Load Button <img alt="Load Button" src="./icons/document-open-data.png"/>.</p>
<p>You then decide on the number of times you want to <strong>repeat the event</strong> in each simulation state. You do this with the Event Repetitions selector.
<em>Note that the event will be executed in each simulation state, so if you previously ran 10 repetitions from the Configuration Files tab, and now you are repeating an event 10 times, you will be executing 100 simulations.</em></p>
<p>Repeating events is useful when the event is not deterministic, for example for <a href="https://github.com/robertour/cultural-simulations/wiki/D.-Events">Uniform and Normal Distributions</a>. In the case of Normal or Neumann distributions, it makes more sense to select the center of the event randomly (i.e. set the row and col parameters at -1). If you don't select an event, you are basically resuming the simulation set from the saved simulation state.</p>
