          <p>Welcome to the App4Apps wiki! Soon to be called something like TrendyBot, or hipsterWhisper or something-  (officially trademark both of these if they are available)</p>
<p>Talking to Miles on 2/2/2016, we've decided that to move this project forward we will be making use of Twitters excellent API and using tweets as the main data source.</p>
<p>The intention is to train the models on trending hashtags, and then join the conversation with made up tweets.</p>
<p>To handle the much larger data throughput we will be moving the computations to AWS, potentially Saulgill there as well.</p>
<p>Long term plans, we'd like to deploy multiple models and test their realisticness using some metrics such as retweets.</p>
<p>Immediate Action Items:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explore using using models
<ul>
<li>The famed char-rnn</li>
<li>A multi-layer perceptron might allow us to not actually keep an data in memory (aws costs money)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Long term goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Compare how people perceive different algorithm's results - retweets?</li>
<li>Compare computational load of algorithms - try to maximize retweets w.r.t. cost on AWS (AWS has a very explicit cost metric of cycles to $)</li>
<li>Explore algorithms that use lots of streaming data to train, but little footprint on AWS.</li>
</ul>
