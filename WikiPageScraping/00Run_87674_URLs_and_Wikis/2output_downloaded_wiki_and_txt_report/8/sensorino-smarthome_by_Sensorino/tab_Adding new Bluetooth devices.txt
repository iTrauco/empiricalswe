          <p>Communication with Bluetooth Low-Energy devices is currently done through the <a href="https://github.com/Sensorino/sensorino-smarthome/blob/master/base-ble-dbus.py"><code>base-ble-dbus.py</code></a> Base script and uses Bluez's D-Bus interface which is very new and experimental at the time of writing.</p>
<p>Since very few profiles have been standardized within the GATT Bluetooth profile (used by Low-Energy devices), most manufacturers use ad-hoc profiles causing the need for a special handler for each single Bluetooth Low-Energy devices on the <em>client side</em> (Bluetooth client side, i.e. in the base script in our case).</p>
<p>These handlers / drivers are towards the bottom of the <code>base-dbus-ble.py</code> script.  Only the following devices are currently supported:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Simplelink_SensorTag" rel="nofollow">Texas Instruments <em>SensorTag</em></a>,</li>
<li>
<em>Yeelight Blue</em> RGB smart lightbulb.</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the D-Bus interface is experimental and not fully implemented in Bluez at this time, a second base script, perhaps based on the <em>gatttool</em>-based python bindings, may be implemented.  The device handlers should stay the same so in that case they'll probably be moved to a file of their one in the server's source tree.</p>
<p>The script's internal API is made so that adding new device handlers should be very easy.  One class must be created to support a GATT <em>Characteristic</em> and it must be added to the <code>char_classes</code> list in the file.  The class's <code>uuid</code> member causes the script to trigger the class instantiation when a characteristic of given UUID is found.  The class should use the <a class="internal present" href="/Sensorino/sensorino-smarthome/wiki/Integrating-Radio-Technologies">base_lib API</a> to translate the characteristic to a Sensorino data channel.</p>
<p>GATT Services map to Sensorino services and GATT Devices map to Sensorino nodes.</p>
