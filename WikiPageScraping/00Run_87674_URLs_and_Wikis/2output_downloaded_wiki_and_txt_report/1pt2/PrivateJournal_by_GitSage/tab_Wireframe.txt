          <p>I've completed a wireframe for the front end of the project. I may or may not go back and edit it later. The wireframe is actually very close to the aesthetic I'm going for: simple, clean, with a white background and thin gray lines to separate things.</p>
<p>Since my front-end is so simple, I decided that the best way to wireframe this was with Google Slides. The slides are not linked together properly, but with only 8 different slides, I feel like it's obvious enough which slide needs to go where.</p>
