          <p>Hey guys, this is the wiki for PrivateJournal. If anybody wants to jump in and collaborate, send me a message first and we'll get to work on it.</p>
<p>For anyone who runs into this repository from outside my CS360 class: hello. I didn't expect to ever see you here. I'm doing this as a project for a class. I don't expect to complete all the features that I want to (especially the security features).</p>
<p>This project is completely free and open-source. I have no interest in keeping it for myself.</p>
