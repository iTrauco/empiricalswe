          <p>et’s assume you want to register a demo for a application ( Desktop or Web).
You do arrange the database and you make some repetition before. However, the database must be re-arranged the next time you will make the demo.
For this case you can use EF 6 Record and play – it will make a .zip file with containing resultsets and you can make indefinitely the repetition of the demo – without the real database.</p>
<p>Let’s see in action at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W64m5A0ikMU" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W64m5A0ikMU</a>
The code is simple</p>
<pre><code> Database.SetInitializer&lt;ContextForDatabase&gt;(null);
 #set record EF
 record = new InterceptionRecordOrPlay(@"DemoEmployeeAndDepartment.zip", ModeInterception.Play);
 DbInterception.Add(record);
 #endregion
</code></pre>
