          <p>Let’s suppose that a department should have the name not null – and , by mistake, we have not prevented the registering of a null in the name of the department
We put those lines</p>
<pre><code>#region set record EF
record = new InterceptionRecordOrPlay(@"DemoEmployeeAndDepartment.zip", ModeInterception.Record);
DbInterception.Add(record);
#endregion
</code></pre>
<p>We register the null name department and  in the DemoEmployeeAndDepartment.zip we see the error
INSERT <a href="%5BNameDepartment%5D">Department</a>
VALUES (NULL)
; SELECT [Id]
FROM [Department]
WHERE [Id] = CAST (@@IDENTITY AS int)</p>
<p>The column cannot contain null values. [ Column name = NameDepartment,Table name = Department ]</p>
