          <p>During our next week I have been working on decoding "Agile Web Development with Rails 4" book. And yes, I used decoding on purpose, as some of the things are still a foreign language for me. There have been things that run smoothly, and others that I couldn't get through. I wanted to be more independent, and not write to Jana with every small question, so I looked some things on line. But when I have hit a bricked wall, I write to Jana for help. Every little thing I accomplish I am being proud of, it keeps me motivated and focused on the project. On out last call, Jana asked me to write to her more often, with all the issues I stumble upon. And I will do that from now on, I know I can learn from Jana a lot :)
I have went through first 4 chapters of the book and learner a lot, for example about how Ruby works in general, what's a directory, and what is a Model-View-Controller framework.
Next week plan: getting down to coding! I'll create a prototype of first thing on my list, that is: homepage. And then, the coding begins :)</p>
