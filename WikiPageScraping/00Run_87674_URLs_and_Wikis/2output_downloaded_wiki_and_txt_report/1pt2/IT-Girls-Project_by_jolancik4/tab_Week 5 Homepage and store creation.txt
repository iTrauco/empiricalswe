          <p>Hi there, still here and I keep going! :)</p>
<p>I'm moving forward with coding, the homepage keeps looking better and better, I have created a Cart, user interface to logging in and the web page starts looking more and more like an on line store, which makes me really happy.</p>
<p>It's Holiday's time so I wish you all fruitful cooperation with your mentors (like mine is :) ), good health and lots of fun with the Learn IT Girl project!</p>
