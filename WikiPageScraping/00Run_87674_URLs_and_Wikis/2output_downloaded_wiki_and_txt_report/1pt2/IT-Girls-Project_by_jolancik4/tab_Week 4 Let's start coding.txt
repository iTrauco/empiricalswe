          <p>After learning the basics my next goal is to create something myself. As the first thing to do I have chosen to create the index (homepage) of my website called Herba'spice. Jana has motivated me to create a prototype, to draw how I would like for my homepage to look like. I have done it quite fast, but the creation of it wasn't so quick and easy.</p>
<p>I have worked on the page layout, going alongside with the book I've mentioned earlier: "Agile Web Development with Rails". I had some problems, and the Homepage still looks a little "without shape" but I keep going forward :)</p>
