          <p>First meeting behind us.
We have created my Git account and new repository called "IT Girls Project", where I will be uploading
my progress and my work. Jana has sent me lots of useful links with installs and tutorials, so now I will get to know Ruby and Ruby on Rails. Challenge accepted! Lots of information, but I keep the positive attitude, it's never easy at the beginning, but I can see that it will be rewarding.</p>
