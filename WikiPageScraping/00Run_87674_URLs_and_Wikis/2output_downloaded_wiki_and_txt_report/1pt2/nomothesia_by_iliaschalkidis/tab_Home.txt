<p>Νowadays, unlike many EU countries, there is not a machine-readable standard for Greek legislation, therefore there can be no advanced legal web services in Greece. Οur objective is to contribute in legal knowledge’s representation and its integration in the area of Open Data in Greece, both from a technological perspective and in terms of transparency. This paper introduces Nomothesi@, a platform to provide access to Greek legislation, by means of a legal XML syntax and linked data. Nomethesi@ proposes a XML standard for Greek legal documents and adopts CEN Metalex OWL ontology’s core, alongside with other RDF metadata, to describe the legislative relationships and events. Linking data is about interlinking and publishing openly Greek public data and legislative data across EU in order to enhance E-Government. On these fundamentals, we build a Content Management System (CMS) in order to manage legislation’s archive and web services for searching and browsing legislation.</p>
