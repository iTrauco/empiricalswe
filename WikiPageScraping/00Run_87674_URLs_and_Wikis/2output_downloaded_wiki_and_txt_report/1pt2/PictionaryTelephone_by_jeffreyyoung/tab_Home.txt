          <p>#Welcome to the PictionaryTelephone wiki!</p>
<p>###What is Pictionary Telephone?</p>
<p>The origins of “Telephone Pictionary” come from two other popular games that you have probably played at one point or another. One is “Telephone,” where you pass a phrase along a string of people and see how horribly mangled or well intact the phrase is at the end of the line, and the other is “Pictionary,” where you draw an object or phrase and try to get people to guess what said drawing or phrase is. (from <a href="http://derailedtelephonepictionary.wordpress.com/what-is-telephone-pictionary/" rel="nofollow">http://derailedtelephonepictionary.wordpress.com/what-is-telephone-pictionary/</a> )  To play someone writes a phrase, the next person draws the phrase, the following person writes a phrase representing what the previous person drew, and so one and so forth.  As time goes on the phrases and picture slowly evolve.</p>
