          <p>Things are starting to begin to catch momentum for my project. I'm finding out learning Ruby on Rails and all of its configurations can be very timely. Nevertheless, I have finally been successful at deploying my project over justinmadsen.me. Because I am alone in this project, everything so far has been implemented by me.</p>
<p>As of December 1, I have been able to create the GUI for my new app with bootstrap for CSS designs, create the Users table for anyone who registers an account on the app, and a way for a user to create an account and login/logout of the app.</p>
<p>The login process I have chosen for my app is through a password and a password confirmation, which if and only if they match up will a user be created in the database.</p>
<p>I have been having some complications getting everything to move over perfectly from my development environment to the live environment, mainly because development is on my personal computer (a Mac OS) and production is over Ubuntu so I get different errors for each environment when implementing a new gem to the program. The errors mainly have to do with CSS but I also have some minor errors with logging in and out. Hopefully I can get those bugs fixed up before I submit this project</p>
<p>Before the end of this project, I would like it if the user could view other users on the app, invite them to play tennis, and record whether or not they beat the opponent. Fortunately, I feel like the worst part is over and I am finally understanding Ruby on Rails so I feel my productivity will be a lot more efficient for the rest of the app.</p>
