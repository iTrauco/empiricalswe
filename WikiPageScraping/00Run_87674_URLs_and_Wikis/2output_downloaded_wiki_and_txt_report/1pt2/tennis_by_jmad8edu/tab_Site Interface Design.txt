          <p>When someone accesses the site, they will be taken to the index_guest.html page. Here is a brief description of the site and a button that allows them to register an account. If they click that button, they will be taken to the register.html page, which allows them to create a new account. If they already created an account, they can click on the "log in" button in the top right of the page, which directs them to the login.html and allows them to enter their credentials.</p>
<p>Once logged in, they are directed to the index_user.html page, that displays a feed of recent events (including who recently won who in a match, invitations from other players, or news from the tennis world). The nav bar of the page will have more links once a user is logged in, including the link "Invite Others" Once this link is clicked, the user is directed to the search.html page, which can also be accessed from searching up a particular player. This displays, in order of most relevant, other players nearby with similar playing levels. From here, the user can invite any other players to play a game of tennis.</p>
<p>There is also a drop down box in the nav bar that has links to the user's account, history, and schedule. The account link directs the user to the my_account.html page which allows them to edit their information. The history link leads to the my_record.html page and displays the user's history from playing other players. The schedule link leads to the my_schedule.html page and displays future games in store for the user that they have already established with other players.</p>
