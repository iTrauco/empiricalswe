          <p>This is a draft algorithm for automatically extracting routes from vessel positions.</p>
<p>Given a point A and a point B we have timestamped vessel positions for vessels travelling from <em>close to</em> A to <em>close to</em> B. (<em>Close to</em> is really defined by the set of positions chosen and the boundary fragments described below).</p>
<p>For both A and B we also have a boundary fragment (perhaps a straight line for convenience) corresponding to the perpendicular to the route. We need to describe this perpendicular because if we are to appropriately time translate and time rescale the tracks into a route we need to accurately predict the start and end points of each vessel in terms of the positions on the A and B boundary fragments.</p>
<p>Choose a constant voyage duration T (say one day).</p>
<p>Choose a number of timesteps n, say 100.</p>
<p>For a vessel V predict the time and position of the vessel as (t<sub>0</sub>, p<sub>0</sub>) on the A boundary fragment.</p>
<p>Translate all the positions of V in time so their origin is now t<sub>0</sub>  (t := t - t<sub>0</sub>) and then scale all the position times so that the time to travel from the A boundary fragment to the B boundary fragment is T seconds.</p>
<p>Now for i = 0 to n predict the position of the vessel V (based on the translated and scaled times) at time i*(n/T). That position is p<sub>i</sub>.</p>
<p>So for each vessel for each timestep i we have their adjusted position p<sub>i</sub>. For a given timestep i we thus have a set of positions P<sub>i</sub>. On the assumption that the vessels would spread out perpendicular to the route we seek to describe, we need an algorithm to deduce the spread and orientation of that perpendicular. We also will likely want to choose a subset Q<sub>i</sub> of P<sub>i</sub> that contains say z=85% of the points in P<sub>i</sub> and minimizes the physical spread of the points (using say the maximum distance between points). The position of the route at that timestep might be given as the centre of the line joining the points from Q<sub>i</sub> that are maximally distant and the spread and orientation of the route at that point would be given by that line.</p>
<p>For the case where between A and B there are multiple distinct routes, we would hope that an appropriate percentage z would pick out the <em>primary</em> route if one existed. If not the route width could be undesirably large and the route detection would be considered to have failed.</p>
