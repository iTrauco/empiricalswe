          <p>The view that loads our "add a new place" form is under <code>src/base/static/js/views/place-form-view.js</code>, which loads templates from <code>src/base/jstemplates/place-form.html</code>. You can find all of our existing view and templates in those folders as well.</p>
<p>If it helps, you can see that our client side application start loading from <code>src/flavors/duwamish_flavor/templates/index.html</code>, which extends <code>src/base/templates/base.html</code>. The script tags that load our views and configurations are in that <code>base.html</code> file.</p>
<p>The configuration file is under <code>src/flavors/duwamish_flavor/config.yml</code>, which stores our place configuration under the <code>place</code> key:
<a href="https://github.com/smartercleanup/duwamish/blob/master/src/flavors/duwamish_flavor/config.yml#L459">https://github.com/smartercleanup/duwamish/blob/master/src/flavors/duwamish_flavor/config.yml#L459</a></p>
<p><strong>Here are the config loading details, if interested:</strong>
The config file is parsed by our Django application here:
<a href="https://github.com/smartercleanup/duwamish/blob/master/src/base/config.py#L95">https://github.com/smartercleanup/duwamish/blob/master/src/base/config.py#L95</a>
which is called from here: <a href="https://github.com/smartercleanup/duwamish/blob/master/src/base/views.py#L65">https://github.com/smartercleanup/duwamish/blob/master/src/base/views.py#L65</a>
which gets loaded into a Python dict object, passed into a context variable and loaded into our html here:
<a href="https://github.com/smartercleanup/duwamish/blob/master/src/base/views.py#L124">https://github.com/smartercleanup/duwamish/blob/master/src/base/views.py#L124</a>
The request is rendered using <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.8/topics/http/shortcuts/" rel="nofollow">Django's render shortcut</a> to render our <code>src/flavors/duwamish_flavor/templates/index.html</code> file, which extends our <code>src/base/templates/base.html</code> file that passes the config to our views.</p>
<p>You can see our place config get passed here:
<a href="https://github.com/smartercleanup/duwamish/blob/master/src/base/templates/base.html#L294">https://github.com/smartercleanup/duwamish/blob/master/src/base/templates/base.html#L294</a>
which gets loaded into our router, which loads our app-view here:
<a href="https://github.com/smartercleanup/duwamish/blob/master/src/base/static/js/routes.js#L57">https://github.com/smartercleanup/duwamish/blob/master/src/base/static/js/routes.js#L57</a>
which loads our place-form-view here:
<a href="https://github.com/smartercleanup/duwamish/blob/master/src/base/static/js/views/app-view.js#L360">https://github.com/smartercleanup/duwamish/blob/master/src/base/static/js/views/app-view.js#L360</a>
and our place-form-view loads the context in its <code>render()</code> method here:
<a href="https://github.com/smartercleanup/duwamish/blob/master/src/base/static/js/views/place-form-view.js#L23">https://github.com/smartercleanup/duwamish/blob/master/src/base/static/js/views/place-form-view.js#L23</a>
Hopefully that helps!</p>
