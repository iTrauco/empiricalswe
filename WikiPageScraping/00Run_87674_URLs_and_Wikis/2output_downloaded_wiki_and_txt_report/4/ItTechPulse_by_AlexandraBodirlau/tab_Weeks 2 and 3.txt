          <p>In these two weeks I learned Python. I started with an interactive tutorial on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com" rel="nofollow">Codecademy</a> and continued with some advanced concepts like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Deal with internal mechanism, i.e what are some methods which executed when you call a attribute, write a    attribute, read a attribute, create an instance of class, delete an instance of class. How you can modify their    behaviour.</li>
<li>Descriptors</li>
<li>Decorators</li>
<li>Generators</li>
<li>Iterators</li>
<li>Meta class</li>
<li>Singleton</li>
</ul>
