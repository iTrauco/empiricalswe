          <p>The transaction process is that by which a <a class="internal present" href="/BlueHuskyStudios/Commission.Me/wiki/Buyer">buyer</a> purchases a <a class="internal absent" href="/BlueHuskyStudios/Commission.Me/wiki/work">work</a> from a <a class="internal present" href="/BlueHuskyStudios/Commission.Me/wiki/Seller">seller</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>The seller sets up his work and makes it visible to the buyer.</li>
<li>The buyer finds one of the seller's works.</li>
<li>If the seller hasn't marked the work's price as final, the buyer now has the opportunity to haggle down or tip if they think the original price isn't right.</li>
<li>The seller is now alerted that someone wants to buy something.</li>
<li>If the seller didn't set the price as final, they now have the opportunity to either accept the offered price, haggle up, or discount the work. If they change the price, the buyer is alerted and they again have the opportunity to change it.</li>
<li>Once a price has been agreed upon, the buyer is alerted and can pay for the work.</li>
<li>The buyer's money goes into the Commission.Me vault.</li>
<li>The seller now has until their pre-set creation time is up to finish the work.</li>
<li>If the seller does not finish in time, the buyer gets their money back and is alerted. The buyer then has the option to extend the deadline if they want to wait longer than was initially advertised, or to cancel the order with no drawbacks.</li>
<li>If the work is finished in time, they tell Commission.Me and must deliver the piece to the buyer. (initially, only digital sales will be allowed, so delivery would be done by uploading the work to Commission.Me for the buyer to download. Later, we will try to incorporate mail-tracking to allow physical works)</li>
<li>If/When the work arrives, the seller is paid and the transaction is closed. If the buyer thinks the work isn't what they paid for, they will have to settle outside of Commission.Me.</li>
<li>Both buyer and seller now have a chance to rate each other. These ratings will be displayed publicly so that future buyers and artists can beware of potential untrustworthiness.</li>
</ol>
