<p>Mikecraft has a very select number of original textures, but includes many textures from other games such as Mojang AB's <em>Minecraft</em>. These game influences has helped to keep Mikecraft alive when there wasn't much interest in it. Mikecraft is a game completely based in java using the help of the Lightweight Java Gaming Library (LWJGL) and the Slick-Utility libraries. Currently Mikecraft has a very limited gameplay with only two stages withing world one, both of which are functional, and multiple player skins which can be changed withing the code.</p>
