          <p>Welcome to the boxed-in-solver wiki!</p>
<p>The purpose of the code here is to solve every level in the Boxed In iPhone games, Boxed In 1-3.</p>
<p>My implementation of the solver uses A* search.</p>
<p><a href="http://solverstats.com" rel="nofollow">http://solverstats.com</a> shows the current status of various Boxed In level solvers. The code in this repository is registered there as solver "AStar_01_02".</p>
<p>If you have an interest in algorithms, programming and/or the Boxed In games, I encourage you to make a solver or improve this one!</p>
