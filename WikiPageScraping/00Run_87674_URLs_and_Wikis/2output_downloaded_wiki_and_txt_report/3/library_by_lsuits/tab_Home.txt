          <ul>
<li>
<p>Should I make logs for this mod?
There was a log.php file from the mod/label codes I was using</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I’m not sure the function mod_library_cm_info_view(cm_info $cm) {
line 160 of lib.php
is really the best way of doing this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>access.php - just copied labels access.php since it’s very similar, however, label had a lot of DnD image<br/>
capability so we could probably get rid of the RISK_XSS , maybe.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>in version.php
what the required moodle version be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>edit link doesn’t work right after first installed, but if you click on turn editing off, and turn editing back on<br/>
can use Edit drop down again, same with label, which is why its weird.</p>
</li>
</ul>
