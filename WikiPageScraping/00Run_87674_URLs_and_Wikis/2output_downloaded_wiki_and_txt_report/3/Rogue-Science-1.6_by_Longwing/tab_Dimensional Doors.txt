          <p>The Dimensional Doors mod adds four significant things to the world that players should know about:</p>
<p>1 - Pocket dimensions: A dimensional door, placed in the world, will lead to a blank space. This is a pocket dimension. While mildly creepy, these dimensions are perfectly safe. You could establish a base here, a storehouse only one block in size, or an extra room for your mansion that takes up no physical space.
2 - Dimensional Transportation - Using Rift Signatures, you can deliberately link two different locations using dimensional doors. This trick works across multiple dimensions. This allows for the generation of in-game quick travel without any admin help. This also works quite nicely with the other dimensional mods in the game, allowing you to easily connect the dimensions you visit back to home.
3 - Dimensional Dungeons - Look for (and beware of!) structures like these. They'll show up from time to time in the game. These are Dimensional Dungeons. They lead to an enormous maze of interconnected pocket dimensions. There's fabulous loot to be found here, along with incredible danger. It's pretty easy to die in a Dimensional Dungeon
4 - Limbo. If you die in a Dimensional Dungeon, or if you get caught by one of the Dimensional Dungeon's denizens, you'll be transported to the dimension at the end of the universe. Limbo, the place where all matter goes once it decays. There are only two ways out of limbo: Magic (Dimensional doors, Linking Books, Crystal Wings...) or by finding the Sea of Limbo. The sea is located at the bottom of Limbo, and can be reached by running... A lot. You cannot take falling damage here, but please be wary of the creatures that live in Limbo. If they turn their gaze upon you long enough, you won't be leaving.</p>
