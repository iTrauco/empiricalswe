          <p>In addition to mods that let you do more interesting things inside Minecraft, Rogue Science also features a number of changes to the world itself. These changes are pretty extensive, so rather than going over each and every one individually, I'm going to cover them in aggregate here:</p>
<p>###More Biomes
Rogue Science features a collection of Biomes from both ExtrabiomesXL and Biomes O Plenty. There are dozens of new environments to explore. These biomes do more than simply change the color of the grass, you'll find new plants, new trees, and even poisonous (or beneficial!) water supplies.
###More animals and monsters
There's a significant collection of new animals and monsters, provided by MoCreatures and Project Zulu. These animals vary from adorable bunnies to bloodthirsty werewolves, and everything in between.
###A weirder nether
Forget the endless maze of boring red stone and lava. The nether now features it's own biomes, plant life, and MANY more mobs. There's now viable ore here too! It's both more dangerous and more beautiful.
###Better exploration
You will find many new structures dotted across the landscape, these are added by a whopping 5 new mods. Better Dungeons, Project Zulu, Ruins, Battle Towers, and Floating Islands. Some of these structures are simple ruins, others contain deadly traps and new enemies. All of them contain valuable loot that can really improve your game. Rather than spoil all these structures for you, I'll leave it to you to explore. Let me just say, don't go in while carrying things you don't want to lose. Some of these places are downright deadly.</p>
