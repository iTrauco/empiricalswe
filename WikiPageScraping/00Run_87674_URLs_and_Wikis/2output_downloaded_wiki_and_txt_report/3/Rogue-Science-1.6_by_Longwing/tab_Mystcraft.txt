<p>Mystcraft adds the entire magical system from Myst into the world. There's an enormous amount of information to take in if you want to start exploring Ages. Before I begin, a warning: Never walk the Ages if you don't have a way back. Always start a journey with at least one way to return to the Overworld (A linking book or Rift Signature, for example). Myst is as much about getting lost as it is about discovering things. You can very easily become trapped in an Age if you're not careful.</p>
<p>#Getting started with Mystcraft</p>
<p>In addition to a few new blocks, you'll need a stock of Leather, Paper, and Ink to get started in Mystcraft. Leather and paper are familiar, ink uses the following recipe:</p>
<p><img alt="" data-canonical-src="http://sunkenlibrary.com/open/Rogue.Science.1.6.4/Myst-ink.png" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/267e60081be23843388bef32c79318857c184c60/687474703a2f2f73756e6b656e6c6962726172792e636f6d2f6f70656e2f526f6775652e536369656e63652e312e362e342f4d7973742d696e6b2e706e67"/></p>
<p>Since Ink Sacs can be hard to find, you can convert coal to ink sacs. Just place coal in a crafting table to extract Ink Sacs. This makes Ink into a properly cheap resource.</p>
<p>###Ink Mixer
Once you have paper, leather, and Ink, you'll want to build an Ink Mixer<br/>
<img alt="" data-canonical-src="http://sunkenlibrary.com/open/Rogue.Science.1.6.4/myst-ink-mixer.gif" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/2f8e6f17550d61e4b7e048fd7b08c5431ef30e02/687474703a2f2f73756e6b656e6c6962726172792e636f6d2f6f70656e2f526f6775652e536369656e63652e312e362e342f6d7973742d696e6b2d6d697865722e676966"/></p>
<p>Place the mixer in the world. You can then use it to make Linking Panels. To use it, place ink bottles in the upper left, and paper in the lower left. You can then take linking panels from the lower right:<br/>
<img alt="" data-canonical-src="http://sunkenlibrary.com/open/Rogue.Science.1.6.4/Myst-Ink-Mixer-Use.png" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/0ce43ce547b1839cd241f40f8d7fc330b3661047/687474703a2f2f73756e6b656e6c6962726172792e636f6d2f6f70656e2f526f6775652e536369656e63652e312e362e342f4d7973742d496e6b2d4d697865722d5573652e706e67"/><br/>
Each time you remove a linking panel, you use up a bottle of ink. The mixer will return the empty bottles to you. You need the linking panels to create linking books and Age books.</p>
<p>The Mixer has a number of other advanced functions, but those are well beyond the scope of this guide. Let's just stick to normal Link Panels for now.</p>
<p>###Linking books
Once you have a link panel, you can make a linking book. Use the following recipe:<br/>
<img alt="" data-canonical-src="http://sunkenlibrary.com/open/Rogue.Science.1.6.4/myst-linking-book.png" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a06bb9af129832fe20c7116b9c55f524c6aa6e5f/687474703a2f2f73756e6b656e6c6962726172792e636f6d2f6f70656e2f526f6775652e536369656e63652e312e362e342f6d7973742d6c696e6b696e672d626f6f6b2e706e67"/></p>
<p>These books are UNLINKED. To link one, place it in your hotbar and rightclick. The book will now be permanently bound to where you're standing. You can use this book to return to this spot. The book won't work while you're in the same dimension, but it WILL bring you back from another Dimension or Age. You should bring multiple LINKED linking boos with you when you walk the ages (Don't leave them unlinked!)</p>
<p>###Book Binder
Make a few linking books, and link them to your current location. Then make a few extra Linking Panels. It's now time to build some Descriptive Books using the Book Binder.<br/>
<img alt="" data-canonical-src="http://sunkenlibrary.com/open/Rogue.Science.1.6.4/myst-bookbinder.gif" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f1c3cc7abdfbe42b1f1581bd235d5e0ec36abfef/687474703a2f2f73756e6b656e6c6962726172792e636f6d2f6f70656e2f526f6775652e536369656e63652e312e362e342f6d7973742d626f6f6b62696e6465722e676966"/></p>
<p>Place the bookbinder, then use it to open it's interface. Place some leather in the left slot and a linking panel in the main area. Then take your new Descriptive Book from the right slot.<br/>
<img alt="" data-canonical-src="http://sunkenlibrary.com/open/Rogue.Science.1.6.4/Myst-BookBinder2.png" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/c0b667855cc2078a57a3937e688ff158375b25fb/687474703a2f2f73756e6b656e6c6962726172792e636f6d2f6f70656e2f526f6775652e536369656e63652e312e362e342f4d7973742d426f6f6b42696e646572322e706e67"/></p>
<p>Like the Ink Mixer, there's a LOT more that a bookbinder can do, but we're only getting started with Mystcraft, so let's stick to the basics.</p>

<p>So now you have a Descriptive book, and a LINKED (really, this is pretty important) Linking Book. You need somewhere to place your Descriptive Book. If you use the Descriptive Book right from your hotbar, it will fall to the floor where you're standing. Descriptive Books and Linking Books are fragile, so let's build a stand to store them.</p>
<p><img alt="" data-canonical-src="http://sunkenlibrary.com/open/Rogue.Science.1.6.4/myst-book-stand.png" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/eb1a28c935b5e7f05b3fc59468febb898d481541/687474703a2f2f73756e6b656e6c6962726172792e636f6d2f6f70656e2f526f6775652e536369656e63652e312e362e342f6d7973742d626f6f6b2d7374616e642e706e67"/></p>
<p>Place your new Descriptive Book on the stand. You're finally ready to travel. The Descriptive Books you make using this guide will lead to completely random Ages. Anything and everything you can imagine could be waiting on the other side of that book. Take at least two LINKED linking books with you when you go. An extra stand wouldn't be a bad idea either. These Ages can be very dangerous, so tread carefully.</p>
<p>#Advanced Mystcraft
I've only touched on the very beginning of exploring Ages in Mystcraft. It's possible to write your own ages with attributes customized according to your own personal preferences. It's also possible to write linking books that work within a single dimension, or even create linking portals that allow for easy travel. The possibilities are enormous. Here are a few resources to get you started:</p>
