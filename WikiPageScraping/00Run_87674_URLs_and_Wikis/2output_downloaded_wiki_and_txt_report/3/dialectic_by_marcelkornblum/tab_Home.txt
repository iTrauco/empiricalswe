          <p>Dialectic intends to become an online tool to enable UK voters to discuss and collaboratively form policies; promoting rational, measured debate and fostering creative decisionmaking.</p>
<p>It aims to enable closer engagement between government and voters, and being Open Source, can be used by anybody.</p>
<hr/>
<p>It's currently at a very early stage; the groundwork for the application is being laid and technical underpinnings are being built, while research and development of some of the core issues are taking place.</p>
