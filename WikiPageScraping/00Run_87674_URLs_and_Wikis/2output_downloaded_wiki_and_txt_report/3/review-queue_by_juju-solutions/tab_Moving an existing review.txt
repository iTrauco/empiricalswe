          <p>To start, make sure you've pushed the latest charm to the <a href="https://jujucharms.com/docs/devel/authors-charm-store" rel="nofollow">charm store</a> using the new <a href="https://jujucharms.com/docs/devel/authors-charm-store#pushing-to-the-store" rel="nofollow">charm push method</a>. Ingestion and bazaar/launchpad branches no longer work. Once you push your charm to the store, make sure you've <a href="https://jujucharms.com/docs/devel/authors-charm-store#publishing-to-channels" rel="nofollow">published it to the stable channel</a>. Finally, you will need to make sure you've <a href="https://jujucharms.com/docs/devel/authors-charm-store#sharing-charms-and-bundles" rel="nofollow">granted the stable channel</a> to everyone.</p>
<p>Go to the <a href="http://review.juju.solutions/reviews/new" rel="nofollow">Request a new Review</a> and enter the entity URL. This should resemble something like <code>~USER/CHARM-VERSION</code> where <code>VERSION</code> is a numerical value returned during <code>charm push</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, leave a comment on the review page with a link to your LaunchPad bug from the previous review queue. This will allow us to adjust and re-place you at the appropriate spot in the queue.</p>
