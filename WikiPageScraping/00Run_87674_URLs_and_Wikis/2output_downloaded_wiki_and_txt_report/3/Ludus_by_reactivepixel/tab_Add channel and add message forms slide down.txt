          <p>Functionality added by Gabriel Ferraz</p>
<p>In the previous version of this app, "add channel" button and "add msg" button linked to "new channel page" and "new message page" respectively. Through a form displayed in each page users could create a new channel and a new message.
I "migrated" the forms to the respective pages where the buttons "add channel" and "add msg" are located. Now when users click the buttons the forms slide down and allows them to add a new channel and a new message without being taken to a different page.</p>
<p>Additionally, I added notification messages that fade in when a user is not logged in and tries to add a channel or a message.</p>
<p>To add these functionalities I placed the forms markup in the respective pages where I wanted the forms to display. Via controller and view I created conditions that will display the form only if a user is logged in.
Because the forms are hidden and the notice for users who are not logged in are hidden, I used jQuery to toggleSlide the forms when users click the button and added fadeIn to fade in the alert message for users who are not signed in.</p>
<p>jQuery only worked properly when I installed gem 'jquery-turbolinks.' To learn about this gem, visit <a href="https://github.com/kossnocorp/jquery.turbolinks">https://github.com/kossnocorp/jquery.turbolinks</a></p>
