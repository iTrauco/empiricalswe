          <ul>
<li>Rename htp_log() to htp_connp_log(). Use to log events that are not associated with a transaction.</li>
<li>Add htp_tx_log(). Use to log events associated with transactions.</li>
<li>Add unique error code for each event.</li>
<li>Use only WARNING and ERROR log/event levels for now.</li>
<li>Replace tx pointer in htp_log_t with transaction index. This will allow the transaction to be destroyed without leaving dangling pointers.</li>
<li>Use a special statically-allocated htp_log_t instance for memory allocation failures.</li>
<li>Add new field to htp_log_t to indicate traffic direction (INBOUND for HTTP requests, OUTBOUND for HTTP responses). Depending on the inspection context, this might be useful for event prioritization.</li>
</ul>
<p>Todo:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Logging levels are already configurable. Consider having a way to enable/disable certain events. That way the user can elect to receive only events of interest.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add a function to convert htp_log_t structure to a string.</p>
</li>
</ul>
