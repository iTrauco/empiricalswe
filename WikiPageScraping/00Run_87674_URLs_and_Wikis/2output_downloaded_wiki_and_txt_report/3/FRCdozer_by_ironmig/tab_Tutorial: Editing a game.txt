Now it's time to edit it to work exactly how you want</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>It's a good idea to start by setting a description, this should be a few sentences describing what this game is for, what team is using it, etc. It will appear on the homepage for your game.

</li>
<li>
<p>Next you should deside what level of access annoymous users or users whose permission is not specified should have. By default, everyone can just view the game, but not change anything about it. You can block people from even seeing it, or allow everyone to edit it!

</li>
<li>
<p>You can add other users, such as the scouters on your team, and assign them higher levels of access. Be careful to leave atleast one user with level 4 permission, so you can change other people's permissions in the future.

</li>
<li>
<p>Next define some game elements. These are the metrics you will be scoring matches off. They can be numbers, booleans (true of false), or arbitary length strings (a bunch of assorted characters). Avoid spaces in the names of these elements, as there is a bug. Be sure to pick good metrics, as changing these after scouters have started scoring matches can cause issues.

</li>
<li>
<p>You should finnaly define the calcualted metrics of your game. These are calculated bassed off the values of the game elements in a match. For example, you might want a Offense, Defense, and Total score. Just add all of the elements (Numbers and Booleans only) and their associated value. Durring the competition, play around with changing the values of certain elements if you think their value to an alliance has changed. You can add, remove, and change these without any consequences to current data. All previous submissions will be recalcualted with the new metrics!
