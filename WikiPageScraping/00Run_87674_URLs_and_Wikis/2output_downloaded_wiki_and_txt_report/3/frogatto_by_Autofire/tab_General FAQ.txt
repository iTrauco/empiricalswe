          <p>Q: How do I run the game in a different language?</p>
<p>A: Frogatto automatically detects and uses the system language by default. However, you can force it to use a different language by setting the <code>LANG</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>For example, to force Frogatto to display English on Mac and Linux, run <code>LANG=en frogatto</code>.</p>
<p>And on Windows, you can use BAT files @DDR0 posted in this <a href="http://www.frogatto.com/forum/index.php?topic=247.msg1260#msg1260" rel="nofollow">thread</a>, or run the following in a command prompt.</p>
<pre><code>set LANG=en
start Frogatto.exe
</code></pre>
<p>In the future, an easier way to manually select language in game may be added.</p>

<p>Q: Frogatto keeps walking left as soon as I start the game.</p>
<p>A: This has happened to a few people on Linux, and it is due to the system incorrectly recognizing an input device such as mouse as a joystick. A workaround is turn off joystick support in Frogatto. Run <code>frogatto --no-joystick</code>, and this will be saved in the preferences. Alternatively you can edit <code>~/.frogatto/preferences.cfg</code> and add the entry <code>"joystick": false,</code>.
