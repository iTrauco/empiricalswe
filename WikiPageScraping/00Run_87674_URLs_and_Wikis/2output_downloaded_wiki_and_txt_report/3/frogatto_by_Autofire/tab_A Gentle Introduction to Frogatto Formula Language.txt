          <p><a href="http://www.frogatto.com/?p=1060" rel="nofollow">A Gentle Introduction to Frogatto Formula Language</a> is a blog post written in 2012. It is still current as of 2015, although we have added <a class="internal present" href="/Autofire/frogatto/wiki/Data-Types">Data Types</a> since then. The post covers Accessing an Object, Where Clauses, Object Mutation, Basic data types, Basic Operators, Random Numbers, Functions, Lists, Dictionaries, and Recursion. While most of the data is covered in the wiki, the blog post ties it together quite nicely.</p>
