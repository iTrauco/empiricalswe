          <p>UV mapping is the process of mapping co-ordinates in texture space (the uv co-ordinates) to co-ordinates in screen space (the xy co-ordinates).</p>
<p>Debugging node: It's recommended to try the commands on this page and use the command line flag --debug-custom-draw which will illustrate to you what's going on under the covers.</p>
<p>Usually in a sprite-based game you want this to be a direct, 1:1 mapping. So this is what Anura provides by default. However, you can choose to map things differently by accessing the custom object parameters, xy_array, uv_array, and the shortcut, uv_segments.</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<p><code>[set(xy_array, [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1]), set(uv_array, [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1])]</code></p>
<p>This specifies exactly how the object should be drawn. This example gives the default drawing method that Anura uses. Now let's suppose you wanted to displace the top right corner of the object you could do this:</p>
<p><code>[set(xy_array, [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 1]), set(uv_array, [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1])]</code></p>
<p>This would distort the drawing of the object.</p>
<p>These examples just draw the entire object as a single rectangle. Sometimes you might want to divide it up into a lot of little rectangles and then distort many of the vertices in lots of little ways. You can do this conveniently like this:</p>
<p><code>set(uv_segments, [2, 2])</code></p>
<p>This will divide the object twice along both the x and y axis. It's useful to do this in the debug console, then output xy_array and uv_array to see what they are set to. You might also like to set uv_segments like this and then programmatically iterate and modify the xy_array to perform a distortion effect.</p>
<p>Note that the fastest way to do distortions is to set uv_segments and then write a custom shader which has a vertex shader which maps the vertices in some way.</p>
