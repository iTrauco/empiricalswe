          <p>So, you want to make stuff with the Frogatto engine? I like the way you think. Skim <a class="internal absent" href="/Autofire/frogatto/wiki/GeneralGameMakingFAQ">GeneralGameMakingFAQ</a>, it's a very quick start guide. Don't worry if you don't understand all of it (or indeed, any of it), that's what this page is for. Now, have you played the original game?</p><table>

[/object_type]</pre><p>You just added an <em>event</em> and a <em>function</em>, and you did it using two different languages! The first language -- bear with me -- is called the <strong>F</strong>rogatto <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage. FML, as I shall now call it, is everything that's not <strong>F</strong>rogatto <strong>F</strong>ormula <strong>L</strong>anguage. FFL is what's inside the quotes in FML. So, the FML we just wrote makes the <tt>on_process</tt> event to be equal to <tt>set(x,x+1)</tt>, and then the game engine executes on_process. If you're feeling curious, a list of all the FML events is <a class="internal absent" href="/Autofire/frogatto/wiki/ObjectEvents">here</a>, and a list of all the FFL functions is over <a class="internal absent" href="/Autofire/frogatto/wiki/ObjectFunctions">here</a>. Of course, those are Serious Reference Pages, and make rather dense reading, but at least you know where they are now.</p><p>Enough of that junk! Let's make our little target object move diagonally up, because just going right is starting to get so last paragraph. To do this, we'll subtract one from <tt>y</tt>, but we'll have to keep the original bit that subtracts from <tt>x</tt> in there too. To do this, we'll use another function to set the value of <tt>y</tt>. Replace <tt>on_process = "set(x, x+1)"</tt> with</p><pre>	on_process = "[
		set(x, x+1),
		set(y, y-1),

Moving on, let's make the target move up and <em>left</em>. Add this element to the list (keeping the two that are already there): <tt>set(x, x-1)</tt>.

<td>According to basic intuition, and some grade one math, our little target should be going straight up. We added one to x, then we subtracted one from x, so we should have a total of zero movement on the x variable. WHAT YOU SMOKING, LITTLE FROG? ... to explain what is happening, first we set <tt>x</tt> to itself plus one, then we did <tt>y</tt>, then we set <tt>x</tt> to itself less one. <em>However</em>, you remember how I said that we made <tt>on_process</tt> equal to the contents of our quotation marks, THEN the game engine executed <tt>on_process</tt>? Well, by the time we got to figuring out what <tt>set(x, x-1)</tt> was, in our function, the game had not actually <em>set</em> <tt>x</tt> to <tt>x+1</tt>. So, <tt>x</tt> is the same value for both functions. Now, the game happily <tt>set</tt>s <tt>x</tt> the first time, then it does <tt>y</tt>, then it sets <tt>x</tt> a second time and overwrites the change from the first <tt>x</tt>.</td>
<td>The engine behaves bizarre manner because: In your computer, you probably have between two and eight processors, all of which can run Frogatto. However, if core #1 is processing the first set(x) command, and core #2 is processing the set(y) command, and then core #3 is figuring out the results of the second set(x) command... since core #1 hasn't actually figured out the results of set(x) yet, core #3 can't know the answer to the first set(x) when it figures out the value of the second set(x). So that core #3 doesn't have to wait, neither of the set(x)s are <em>applied</em> to x until after everyone is done figuring out what x should be. Since the results of the set commands are applied in sequential order, though, x ends up being the results core #3 figured out. If we didn't do this, we could only use one core to compute results. (I never said we <em>did</em> use more than one core, here, but still. We <em>could</em>.)</td>
<td>Be aware of this behavior - in a big function, it'll introduce bugs that are a bit tricky to find if you don't know about it.</td>
