          <p>When we think about events between client and server, there is some implicit directionality built into our wording.  For example, we may be think about a user add in terms of <code>AddUser</code> and <code>UserAdded</code>.</p>
<p>In order to provide routing with convention instead of static wire-up we have decided to standardize on using the suffix of <code>Request</code> and <code>Response</code> to describe our most common use-case, a single client to the server and back.  For our previous example this would mean <code>UserAddRequest</code> and <code>UserAddResponse</code>.  You will want to inherit <code>RequestBase</code> or <code>ResponseBase</code> when developing this use-case.  When creating a <code>Response</code>, you must past the <code>Request</code> to ensure the message is set to the correct connection.</p>
<p><code>PushBase</code> gives us a way to push out messages to a group that are not necessarily initiated by a request.</p>
<p>By using this convention for routing and not broadcasting every <code>Response</code> we get some built in efficiency, by ensuring the minimum amount of data goes over the wire to fulfill our intent.</p>
