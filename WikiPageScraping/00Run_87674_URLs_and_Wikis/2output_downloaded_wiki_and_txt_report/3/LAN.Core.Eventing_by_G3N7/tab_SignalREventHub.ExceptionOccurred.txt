          <p>Curently the kinds of exceptions that get thrown here are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>ArgumentException</strong> - When an events handler has not been registered, the event names don't line up or the handler's dependencies have not all been registered.</li>
<li>
<strong>AuthenticationException</strong> - When an event is being raised in a context that the user is not allowed to use it.</li>
<li>
<strong>Exception</strong> - Any exception that happens in one of the handler's async invocations will bubble up here as well.</li>
</ul>
<p>Simple Implementation:
<code>SignalREventHub.ExceptionOccured += (sender, args) =&gt; Debugger.Break();</code></p>
<p>However, this is also your opportunity to do logging or any other type of exception handling you would like.</p>
