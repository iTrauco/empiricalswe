          <p>The Production and Staging servers of OpenFarm run on Heroku (as of Jan 8th, 2015).</p>
<p>If the master branch passes all specs, and has been tested locally (regression testing FTW), you can pull down the master branch locally, and push it to heroku (providing you have a heroku instance, or have access to the OpenFarm heroku instance)</p>
