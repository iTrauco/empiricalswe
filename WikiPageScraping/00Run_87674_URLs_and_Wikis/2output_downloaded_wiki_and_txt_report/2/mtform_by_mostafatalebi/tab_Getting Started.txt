          <p>In this section, we create a simple login form with validation and AJAX Submission. MTForm is shipped with several handy and necessary plugins to allows more control over form creation. To create a simple form, you would use <code>$mtf</code> global variable:</p>
<p><code>$mtf.Form("", { id : 'main-form' }).Input("email").Password("password").Submit("submit", { id: "submit" }).Make();</code></p>
<p>The above single line creates a form with two inputs which respectively are "username" and "password". But this is not the end, you may want to add validations to your inputs, MTform comes with several validation rule, but you can also define your own validation (read more about it in the Validations section). To add rules to an input you should do it right after it is called(created), so we change our code to:</p>
<p><code>$mtf.Form("", { id : 'main-form' }).Input("username").VAdd("email").Password("password").VAdd("min", 6).VBind().Submit("submit", { id: "submit" }).Make().VEventize();</code></p>
<p>Now our form is validated against those two rules.
Let's add AJAX functionality to the form(though principally it is not necessary, but many might like to utilize it!):</p>
<p>Rewrite last code to:</p>
<p><code>$mtf.Form("", { id : 'main-form' }).Input("username").VAdd("email").Password("password").VAdd("min", 6).VBind().Submit("submit", { id: "submit" }).Make().VEventize().;</code>
<code>$mtf.Ajax( { url : "form-processor.php", type : "post"}, "click", "#main-form", "#submit");</code></p>
<p>The above code creates a login form with two inputs and one submit button. Each input is then bound to a rule. Eventually the form can be sent via AJAX definition.</p>
