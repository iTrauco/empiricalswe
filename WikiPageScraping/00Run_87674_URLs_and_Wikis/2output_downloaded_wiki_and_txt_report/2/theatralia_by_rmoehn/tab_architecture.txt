<p>some user can set up some his own instance of the system, called here a <strong>node</strong>, on a <strong>server</strong>
so there can be several servers hosting several nodes</p>
<p>on every node some user is managing many <strong>items</strong> in a database
these items can be <em>private</em>, <em>shared</em> and <em>public</em></p>
<p>every node has a homepage-like external appearance that is used to represent research and data of the individual user
for that purpose every node has a special <strong>address</strong> (theatralia.de/ulfotto)
every node also has an <strong>access</strong> to log in and work with the system</p>
<p>the systems can be used by a single user who builds his own private database
several users can additionally share items, then every user keeps a copy of the shared item and modifications must be synced
furthermore, items can be published (made public), so that everybody can use them, these public items should be stored with the user who created respectively last modified them, those users who make use of those public items store a local copy and a pointer to the latest modified version</p>
<p>when an item is shared copys are sent to the sharing users
what happens when an item is published depends on how an item can be found and can be searched…
either there are centralised registries, where all public items are listed
or there is no such thing and looking for public items means sending messages to individual nodes
so the next question is, how do the nodes know of each other?
imagine I set up a new node, then I might get an address from a colleague of his node, or I might look up another colleague in a registry of the discipline, where I also register myself
so every node is linked to some nodes through some “follow” function or because they were looked up, and accordingly with those nodes who these nodes are connecting with respectively, then secondly over some directories of different disciplines
if I search for a public item it means sending a message through this network...</p>
<p>when a shared or public item is modified a message is sent to all or to all sharing, letting them know about the modification</p>
<p>every node communicates with the other instances only through messages
there is no common, only individual databases</p>
<p>basically it shouldn’t make a difference whether two nodes run on the same server or on different ones, either they communicate between processes or between servers over the same protocol</p>
<p>modification to the above: actually every node should be usable by several users (working group or researcher + student assistants)</p>
<p>so there is users, nodes (=database with public view and working view), items</p>
<p>summary: one node = one database, one public webpage, one working access, a couple of users, many items, some of them private, some shared and some public, some links to related nodes and a couple of links to discipline registries with other nodes, a thread waiting for incoming messages, one function sending messages out</p>
