          <p>A basic daemon, called ExaBMP, was created to parse BMP messages for inet.0 routes. It currently prints parsed route sent using draft-1 is out, which is what the latest JunOS version seeems to send.</p>
<p>the daemon is undocumented but the following environment variables can be used :</p>
<ul>
<li>exabmp.bmp.host - IP to listen on</li>
<li>exabmp.bmp.port - port to listen on</li>
<li>exabmp.bmp.json - print json representation of the route (default) or textual ones</li>
<li>exabmp.bmp.asn4 - will the routes received be from peer supporting 32 bits ASN.</li>
</ul>
<p>The data is sent to FD3, which is a copy of FD2, so you should be able to redirect it using normal unix pipe command ..</p>
<p>The issue with draft one, is that no information about the negotiated OPEN for each peer is sent, so parsing the route can not be done without indicating to the daemon what to expect, and as each peer can have different negotiated capabilities, it is no reliable, should any of your peer change its configuration.</p>
<p>This issue was resolved in the latest draft, but this is not what is implemented by JunOS ... I will invest more time in the development of this deamon once JunOS implement the latest draft, which is <em>way</em> better (like making sure it can fork helper process, like ExaBGP).</p>
<p>For information other projects exists (I would not use them more than ExaBMP).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/forhadahmed/bmp">bmp</a> (back online)</li>
<li><a href="https://code.google.com/p/bmpreceiver" rel="nofollow">bmpreceiver</a></li>
<li>[bmpd](<a href="https://github.com/garberg/bmpd">https://github.com/garberg/bmpd</a> bmpd)</li>
</ul>
<p>bmp implemented the latest draft, and was a nicely written implementation - something to look up to :-) ..
bmpreceiver and bmpd implemented earlier draft too and are suffering the same issues as ExaBMP.</p>
