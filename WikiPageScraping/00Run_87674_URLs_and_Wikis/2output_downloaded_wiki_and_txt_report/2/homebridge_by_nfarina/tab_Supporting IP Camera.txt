          <p>This wiki documents how to add IP Camera support for your plugin.</p>
<p><strong>Due to the protocol limitation, user will needs to pair with camera separately.</strong></p>
<p>For homebridge 0.4 or later (API version 2.1), a plugin can publish camera by invoking <code>api.publishCameraAccessories(pluginName, [PlatformAccessory])</code>.</p>
<p>Regarding how to handle the stream and setting up the camera with accessory, please refer to <a href="https://github.com/KhaosT/HAP-NodeJS/wiki/IP-Camera">this wiki page</a> under HAP-NodeJS.</p>
<p>An example plugin can be found at <a href="https://github.com/KhaosT/homebridge-camera-ffmpeg">here</a>.</p>
