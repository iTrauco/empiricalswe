<p>The following features have been added since the previous release.</p>
<ul>
<li>The command terminator may now end a jsqsh command. For example, the following are now legal:
1&gt; \echo hello how are you;
hello how are you</li>
<li>Added new SQL display style <strong>json</strong>
</li>
<li>Added <strong>${histid}</strong> variable that contains the current buffer number you are working on. Really useful for adding to your prompt.</li>
<li>Added support for ARRAY data type and hopefully better support for unrecognized data types.</li>
<li>Added <strong>\show</strong> command which can display almost all of the major database metadata information (tables, functions, columns, procedures, etc.). See "<strong>\help show</strong>" for details.</li>
<li>Added <strong>\prepare</strong> command. The command is mostly used for diagnosing JDBC driver issues/functionality and prepares a SQL statement against the server than displays metadata about the prepared statement, such as what the final result set will look like and the data types of any parameter markers.</li>
<li>Added <strong>${fetchsize}</strong> variable to set the JDBC Statement.fetchSize() property.</li>
<li>Added <strong>${editing_mode}</strong> to allow you to set the editing keymap. Currently this is only supported by JLine, so to switch to "vi" mode, do:
\set editing_mode=vi</li>
<li>Added <strong>${ex_detail}</strong> to adjust the level of detail in exceptions (e.g. whether or not stack traces are included in the output).</li>
<li>Added <strong>${show_exclass}</strong> configuration variables that causes exception class names to be displayed.</li>
<li>Added <strong>--echo</strong> jsqsh flag and <strong>${echo}</strong> variable to echo the input back out to stdout. This is useful when running scripts (non-interactive mode) see both the SQL and commands executed as well as the results.</li>
<li>Added <strong>--var</strong> (<strong>-v</strong>) command line flag which can be used to set the value of a variable like so
jsqsh --var expand=true</li>
<li>Added a significant number of pre-defined JDBC drivers</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The <strong>${expand}</strong> variable now defaults to false, meaning that by default variables are no longer expanded in SQL statements. After some thought I decided this behavior was too dangerous to leave on by default as a "$" is meaningful on some platforms and could break/confuse things. Note that this does not impact variable expansion on jsqsh command line commands, that remains in effect.</li>
<li>Footer information (#rows processed and timing) is now displayed to stderr so that this information isn't written to the output file if the output is redirected.  Use 2&gt;&amp;1 if you want to write this to your output file now.</li>
<li>The default display style for timestamp and date have changed to the ISO standard of <strong>yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss.fff</strong> and <strong>yyy-mm-dd</strong> respectively.</li>
<li>The behavior of setting <strong>${style}</strong> is slightly different now, and is documented in the help for style. The support styles vary based upon the session type e.g. a JDBC session vs. a Jaql session). Setting a SQL style with no session started, or a SQL session started sets it globally for all session. Jaql styles can only be applied during a jaql session, and only sets the value locally for the jaql session.</li>
<li>Upgraded to <strong>jline-2.10</strong>. JLine is an almost pure java line editing library, similar to readline.  This version of jline adds support for most of the basic "vi" command set. It is important to note that this version of jline will recognize and try to honor settings in your ".inputrc" file if you have any set.</li>
<li>Removed support for ANTs DB2 SQL Skin for Sybase ASE driver. The company is all but dead except for the nails in the coffin. Too bad, I was extremely proud of what we built.</li>
<li>The <strong>--debug</strong> (<strong>-b</strong>) flag can now be specified multiple times to enable
multiple debugging categories</li>
<li>The <strong>--input-file</strong> (<strong>-i</strong>) flag can now be specified multiple times, each
input will be processed in order.</li>
<li>The <strong>\help</strong> command will automatically try to launch a pager to page through the help output.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<strong>Switched to Apache 2.0 License</strong>. This has the following side effects (mostly not visible to users)
<ul>
<li>Option processing switched from GNU getopt to my own implementation. I tried to follow getopt behavior, but it may not be exactly the same as it was.</li>
<li>
<strong>JLine</strong> is made default line reader. Readline has to be enabled by the user, and the readline jar is not distributed with jsqsh. For those worried about this descision: java-readline hasn't been updated in over 7 years and JLine 2.x is approaching it pretty well in terms of functionality.  Java-readline can be installed on most linux machines by your package manager, so it is easy to add on.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added support for launching a <strong>Jaql</strong> interpreter from within jsqsh. Jaql is a programming language designed for working with Hadoop. JSqsh's support for jaql consists of:
<ul>
<li>The <strong>\jaql</strong> command starts a Jaql session</li>
<li>The flag <strong>--jaql</strong> when starting jsqsh, automatically starts a session</li>
<li>When in a jaql session, <strong>\go</strong> or the command terminator (";" by default) executes the current statement through the Jaql interpreter.</li>
<li>The variables <strong>${jaql_prompt}</strong>, <strong>${jaql_indent}</strong>, <strong>${jaql_jars}</strong>, **${jaql_path}}, <strong>${jaql_jobname}</strong>, and <strong>${jaql_style}</strong> can be used to affect the behavior of the jaql shell (these are all documented under <strong>\help jaql</strong>).</li>
<li>Jsqsh options <strong>--jaql-path</strong> and <strong>--jaql-jars</strong> have been added. Use of these options implies <strong>--jaql</strong>.</li>
<li>Tab completion will complete any global Jaql variable name.</li>
<li>There are display styles that apply to Jaql: <strong>json</strong>, <strong>csv</strong>, <strong>lines</strong>, and <strong>discard</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added new build target called <strong>dist-bin</strong>. This produces a standalone zip package containing a jsqsh run-time, just like <strong>dist</strong>, but it also includes the jsqsh JNI interface.</li>
<li>The shell script included with <strong>dist</strong> and <strong>dist-bin</strong> is now wired to recognize if $JAQL_HOME is set and to launch jsqsh using the Jaql launcher so it will pick up all the necessary libraries.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Output performance for most output formats is dramatically improved (approx 2x)</li>
<li>Changed the way in which JDBC drivers are loaded via a custom class path (using the ${classpath} variable).  Apparently some drivers don't like to be used directly to establish the connection, so this change will use the JDBC DriverManager to get connections.</li>
<li>Fixed a long standing irritation of empty entries appearing in the <strong>\history</strong> list. Now empty SQL buffers will be thrown away so no empty entries should appear in the history.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where connection names supplied on the command line are not recognized.</li>

<p>I'm currently packaging 1.4 for release (it's a pain to compile for all platforms!). Below is a list of upcoming features.</p>
<ul>
<li>Added support for "JLine" as an input method. JLine is a pure-java (at least on UNIX) library similar to Java-Readline. For portability, java-readline will be tried first, if it is unavailable, JLine will be used.  This support added the following:
<ul>
<li>--readline command line option to specify the input method.</li>
<li>JSQSH_READLINE environment variable can also be used to specify the input method.</li>
<li>The $readline variable can be used to display the currently selected readline implementation.</li>
<li>Added new options to the \insert command:</li>
<li>-t,--terminator=term  Allows you to specify a batch terminator other than "go".</li>
<li>-m,--multi-row Enables support for platforms that allow multiple rows to be specified in a single insert statement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added -n (--repeat) option to \eval allowing the batch of SQL being evaluated to be run multiple times.  Each iteration of evaluation will have a variable ${iteration} set that it can refer to if it wants to vary the SQL behavior by iteration.</li>
<li>Added new command line option "--config-dir" that allows you to specify additional configuration directories to be processed upon start in addition to $HOME/.jsqsh. This option may be specified more than once to load more than one configuration directory.</li>
<li>Added new command line option "--drivers" that allows you to specify additional driver.xml files to be loaded upon startup. This option may be specified more than once.</li>
<li>Added "--load" option to \drivers command to allow you to load additional driver.xml definition files. This is particularly useful to put into your .jsqsh/sqshrc file.</li>
<li>Added "isql" display style, that attempts to format data in a fashion similar to Sybase's isql program.</li>
<li>Added "vertical" (or "vert") display style, that attempts to format in a rotated "name: value" style.</li>
<li>Added documentation for the ${rc} variable. This variable contains the return code from the most recently executed jsqsh command, which will be 0 for success or non-zero for failure.  For example. the \go command returns a non-zero value if the SQL executed failed.</li>
<li>Added ${fail_count} variable that contains the total number of commands that have been executed within the session that have failed (i.e. ${rc} from the command was non-zero).</li>
<li>Jsqsh will now exit with a value indicating the total number of failed commands (which is the sum total of ${fail_count} from each session that was created within jsqsh).</li>
<li>Added ${binstr_fmt}, a boolean variable, that controls whether or not binary values are displayed as raw binary values (false=0xabcd) or as binary string values (true=X'abcd').</li>
<li>Added ${exec_mode} variable that can change the manner in which jsqsh executes SQL against the remote server. This can be one of "immediate" (the default) or "prepare".</li>
<li>Added driver name 'db2zos'. This is identical to the "db2" driver except that it sets the "emulateParameterMetaDataForZCalls" property and sets the execution mode to "prepare" upon connection (DB2 z/OS   can execute "call procname()" calls if the SQL is prepared first).</li>
<li>Added  property in the drivers.xml that allows a driver to set certain session variable values upon connection.</li>
<li>Added --show-password option to "\connect --list" because I keep forgetting passwords to systems.</li>
<li>Added sql-skin driver definition for the IBM DB2 SQL Skin for ASE driver (I happen to work for them, so have a bit of incentive).</li>
<li>The "perfect" display style no longer holds all of the rows in memory prior to display.  Instead, it is now controlled by a new variable ${perfect_sample_rows} (default value 500). So now, ${perfect_sample_rows} rows are held in memory for analysis prior to display. Once this limit has been hit, rows are streamed and no longer held in memory.</li>
<li>The ${maxrows} variable now defaults to 0 (unlimited rows) rather than 500. This is done because the default display style ("perfect") no longer attempts to hold all rows in memory.</li>
<li>Added driver definition for the H2 JDBC driver.</li>
<li>More care is taken to ensure that database connections are actually formally close()'d when jsqsh exits or a session terminates.</li>
<li>When in non-interactive mode, the warning about failures to load the jsqsh JNI interface is suppressed.</li>
<li>When connection arguments are provided on the command line and a connect cannot be established, jsqsh will now exit with an error instead of dropping you into a prompt.</li>
</ul>

<p>Release 1.3</p>
<ul>
<li>The 'dist-rpm' target and has been updated so that it works on more recent RPM distributions (specifically I am running FC10).</li>
<li>Compilation requires JDK 1.6 now due to support for new datatypes. It should run OK in JDK 1.5 provided you don't reference one of those datatypes.</li>
<li>A driver definition (the drivers.xml) file may now contain a new  tag to define properties that are to be passed into the driver at connect time.</li>
<li>The DB2 driver now sets the retrieveMessagesFromServerOnGetMessage property. This results in actual usable error messages.</li>
<li>The \call statement is now capable of displaying Oracle result sets produced from Oracle refcursors. This is done with the special ":r" argument placeholder.  See "\help call" for details.</li>
<li>The "perfect" display mode will now attempt to compact the display columns sufficiently tight to fit within the screen (only if jsqsh JNI is available).</li>
<li>Added mssql2k5 driver definition for the SQL Server 2005 JDBC driver.</li>
<li>History buffer numbers are now numbered oldest to newest, so that the buffer number for a given buffer will not change until the session ends or the buffer is removed from history.</li>
<li>Added --repeat to \go, so that a query can be executed multiple times. During this execution the variable ${iteration} can be referred to within the query to determine which iteration of the repeat cycle the query is on (starting from 0).</li>
<li>Added display style of "discard" that discards all rows. This is useful for performance testing.</li>
<li>Added ${scale} and changed the definition of ${precision}. These two values now work together when displaying floating point  values exactly as one would expect them to.</li>
<li>Added ${querytime} configuration property to suppress display of query timing information.</li>
<li>Added dist-sparc-sol build target. This provides a .tar.gz file that contains jsqsh and its JNI files. Currently this relies upon the build platform having readline-5.x installed</li>
<li>Added support for SQLXML datatype</li>
<li>Enabled support for "N" types, NVARCHAR(), NCHAR(), etc.</li>
<li>Fixed recognition of Oracle NUMBER type when it is not qualified with a specific precision and scale.</li>
<li>Fixed case where stored procedures with multiple result sets would occasionally not show all of the available result sets. Unfortunately,this problem still persists in the SQL Server 2005 driver, but I think its a bug in the driver.</li>
<li>Fixed persistence of the SID attribute of a connection to the connections.xml file.</li>
<li>Fixed NullPointerException when maxrows_method=driver</li>
<li>Fixed $user not being set when the username is provided at the "Username:" prompt rather than on the command line.</li>

<p>This release has a couple of critical bug fixes over 1.1. An upgrade is recommended:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added new mechanism to \connect to allow a logical name to be assigned to a connection and persistently saved away so that the connection can be re-established in the future using only the name. This provides a cleaner mechanism for managing connections than the 'alias' command. Run "\help connect" for more details.</li>
<li>Added session-to-session redirection, allowing the output of a command executed in one session to be executed by another session (or even re-executed by itself). See '\help redirection' for details.</li>
<li>The \call command can now iterate through a CSV file and execute a prepared statement once for each line in the file, using the fields in the file as arguments to the procedure.</li>
<li>Fixed handling of "bit" datatypes.</li>
<li>Fixed ^C handling that I broke the last release.</li>
<li>Fixed the \eval command aborting when it executes a command that causes a session switch, such as \session or \connect -n.</li>
<li>Fixed "\connect -c" not finding classes that are specified in the ${classpath} jsqsh variable.</li>
<li>Fixed OutOfMemoryError when processing the results of a backtick expression (e.g. \set x=<code>echo 1234</code>)
==19-Feb-2008 - 1.1 released==
This release has quite a lot of changes. I think the new graphical capabilities will be of interest to a lot of folks:</li>
<li>Changed several aspects of command line options:
<ul>
<li>All jsqsh options have a long form and a short form (e.g. -h and --help).</li>
<li>You no longer need a space following an option (e.g. "-U sa" and "-Usa" are equivalent).</li>
<li>Every jsqsh command accepts -h and --help to cause a usage of the command to be dumped.</li>
<li>Every jsqsh command accepts -g and --gui to cause its output to be sent to a graphical popup window.</li>
<li>The new help topic "options" discusses this.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Added new display style "graphical" that will pop open a GUI window containing query results in a sortable graphical table.</li>
<li>Added $window_size to control the size of the window in graphical display mode and $font to set the font that will be used.</li>
<li>Added $nocount variable to turn off the display of rowcounts generated due to update/delete statements.</li>
<li>Added \insert command, this displays the results of the current SQL query as INSERT statements or executes the INSERT statements in another session.</li>
<li>Added \select command to generate select statements and joins from table definitions.</li>
<li>Added \create command to generate CREATE TABLE statement from a table definition.</li>
<li>Added \diff command to compare results from SQL executed across multiple session.</li>
<li>Added \call command to execute a prepared statement. This command is primarily for debugging purposes.</li>
<li>The \help command is now more organized.</li>
<li>JSqsh is now better at determining if the session is interactive or non-interactive (i.e. if stdin has been redirected).</li>
<li>Tab completion now recognizes the TSQL "use" statement.</li>
<li>Display of "info" type SQLWarning's (e.g. the output from a "print" statement from Sybase and Microsoft) is improved.</li>
<li>Fixed the -i flag causing jsqsh to exit if the script contained a \connect -n.</li>
<li>Fixed failure when trying to format Oracle TIMESTAMP columns for display.</li>
<li>Fixed \connect command trying to use settings from the current session when trying to connect. Read the \connect command for details.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in PL/SQL parser that cause jsqsh to sit in tight loop eating CPU when parsing certain PL/SQL blocks.</li>
<li>Fixed bug with way getUpdateCount() is being called that was causing Sybase's jConnect driver to complain.</li>
<li>Updated driver definition to use the jConnect 6.x driver for Sybase</li>

<p>I've finally taken a few minutes to put together the 1.0 build. This version includes the following changes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tab completion now recognizes stored procedure execution requests and will attempt to complete parameter names and procedure names.</li>
<li>Added '-i' flag to GO to allow you to generate INSERT statements from a result set.</li>
<li>Added support for CLOB and BLOB datatypes (bug #1820183). Current support requires holding the entire object in memory so be careful!</li>
<li>Added $show_meta variable to display JDBC result set metadata as a separate result set when executing queries.</li>
<li>Added $maxrows_method variable that is used to control the mechanism that jsqsh uses to limit row results. This added because I discovered that setting the row limit in some JDBC drivers caused unwanted side effects.</li>
<li>Added \procs command to display list of procedures in the current database.</li>
<li>Added PL/SQL analyzer so that semicolon termination can be used against Oracle.</li>
<li>Added \debug command to turn on debugging for specific classes.</li>
<li>The \describe command will now describe stored procedure parameters.</li>
<li>Improved formatting of number datatypes (tinyint, int, short, bigint, float, double, etc.) to minimize the amount of space required for display wherever possible.</li>
<li>Fixed the driver definition for the DB2 JDBC driver.</li>
<li>Commands that edit or alter the current SQL buffer will also affect the readline history as if the user had just typed in the buffer. E.g. if you hit '!3' at the prompt to re-load the third oldest query, the readline history will look as if you just typed that query.</li>
<li>Fixed bug #1816504 - Queries returning multiple result sets were getting fouled.</li>
<li>Fixed bug #1820182 - Handling of Oracle NUMBER columns failing during formatting.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that I've needed to actually use JSqsh on a day-to-day basis, I had a lot of features and fixes to roll in to make my life easier. So, here you go!</p>
<ul>
<li>Dramatically improved tab completion. It is now contextual to your position within the SQL statement being written. If the FROM clause has been written or the target of the INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE has been specified, then the completion will restrict itself to that context. This was more difficult than I expected!</li>
<li>Added $headers and $footers configuration variables to control display of result header/footer information</li>
<li>Added -h and -f to the \go command to toggle the display of result header and footer information respectively.</li>
<li>Added "-w domain" flag to \connect so that domain based authentication can be used when connecting. Currently only the mssql-jtds driver recognizes this option.</li>
<li>Added \eval command to read and process the contents of a file.</li>
<li>Added tab completion of procedure names.</li>
<li>Added handling/display of SQL warnings.</li>
<li>Improved formatting of error messages.</li>
<li>Added testing of JVM support for catching CTRL-C. If it is not supported (i.e. the gcj JVM), then a warning message is issued.</li>
<li>Added support for gij (gcj's JVM) 1.5.0</li>
<li>Added default aliases "vi" and "emacs" or \buf-edit</li>
<li>Removed 'csv' display of footer information (rowcounts).</li>
<li>By default the \history command will now only show the first 10 lines of any SQL statement. The -a flag has been added to allow you to see the complete statements if you want.</li>
<li>Fixed OutOfMemoryError when nested SQL exceptions are returned by the server.</li>
<li>Fixed NullPointerException when running non-interactive scripts of SQL via the -i flag.</li>
</ul>

<p>I've rolled a few new changes and bug fixes in since the 0.9.3 release. This version adds the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added tab completion of object names. The logic is pretty smart too, and understands "quoted object names" and [bracketed object names].</li>
<li>Added '-m style' flag to the \go command.</li>
<li>Added new display style 'csv'.</li>
<li>Added new ${classpath} configuration variable to allow the user to specify additional jar locations for JDBC drivers.</li>
<li>Added support for empty passwords</li>
<li>Added new \macro command for defining velocimacros</li>
<li>Fixed documentation for the \connect command</li>
<li>Fixed "-D" flag for the \connect command</li>
<li>Fixed handling of NULL values for binary data types.</li>
</ul>
