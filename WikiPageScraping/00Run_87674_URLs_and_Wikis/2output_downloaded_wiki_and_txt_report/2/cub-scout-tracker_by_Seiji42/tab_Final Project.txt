          <p>Description: The purpose of this site was to make a website that would make it easy for cub scout leaders and parents manage their cub-scouts.  In a neat and organized fashion we wanted to show a list of all the requirements for each rank along with which ones their particular scout had accomplished.  We were able to implement for both Wolfs and Bear scouts the ability to register leaders, parents, and scouts with our system.  Parents and leaders could view their scouts progress as well as submit requirements completed.  Completed requirements could be viewed by any adult with access to that scout at a later time.</p>
<p>Screenshots are at the bottom.</p>
<p>Database Schema: While our original database was a lot more complicated we found it much easier to work with 3 tables.  There is an adult table, a scout table, and a record table.  The main information that our website is required to keep track of is: 1: A list of cub-scouts and 2: a list of the requirements that they have accomplished along with 3: a list of adults who can view what they have accomplished.  A total list of cub-scout achievements is stored as a JSON object in main.js.</p>
<p>The adult table contains basic information about an adult such as their name, phone number, email, etc. It also contains the leader type.  The leader type is either a parent or a leader.  A parent will only have access to the scouts they register with.  A leader has access to all scouts of his rank (webelos, bear, wolf) and pack number.  We also store their username and password for verifying upon login.  adult_id is the primary key.</p>
<p>The scout table as well contains basic information including their rank (webelos, bear, wolf).  Because 1 parent can have multiple scouts (one to many) we have the scout store the id of the parent registered to them.</p>
<p>The record table stores the rank type (Bear or Wolf), the date the record was accomplished, and the id of the requirement completed.  The list of Bear and Wolf requirements is stored in a JSON object.  Each requirement in that object has a unique id that is stored to recall which achievement was accomplished later. This also has a many to one relationship with the scouts so the record stores a scout id.</p>
<p>This is a link to a chart showing the database in more detail.

<p>Future Work: Something that we would implement in the future is adding all of the Webelos requirements. We would also add ways to update parents.</p>

<p>(There are still some bugs, but it kind of works)</p>
<p>There is a parent user (u:Parent, p:Parent)</p>
