          <p>I'm a cub scout den leader, and one of the problems my pack has had in the past is lack of record keeping. I've noticed that one of the causes is that scouts frequently loose their books, and leaders haven't been keeping good track of what their scouts have done. Currently, we've been given binders to write things down, but there isn't much space for noting down partial achievements. I wanted to create a website that would mitigate the paperwork and allow leaders and parents to track their scouts achievements digitally.</p>
<p>Our application will take responsibility for tracking a scout's progress. Parents will want to use this app to help them plan what activities they need to do to assist their scouts advance, and leaders will use it to keep track of achievements and awards.</p>
<p>This app will allow parents to view and input new achievements online. They will be able to see all the activities their scouts have done as well as when they were done. Leaders will be able to do the same for all their scouts. These records will transfer from leader to leader as the scout grows and advances ranks.</p>
<p>A user has varying levels of access based on their role. We will eventually extend this to include scouts of all ages.</p>
<p>A parent can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign-up and request access to their scout's info</li>
<li>view all records of their scout's achievements</li>
<li>add achievements to the database</li>
</ul>
<p>A leader can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign-up and request access to the website</li>
<li>add information for new scouts</li>
<li>view all records of all their scout's achievements</li>
<li>add achievements to the database</li>
<li>receive emails notifying them of awards and advancements</li>
<li>verify awards and advancements have taken place</li>
</ul>
<p>Admins can:</p>
<ul>
<li>do everything a leader can do</li>
<li>accept requests from leaders and parents</li>
</ul>
<p>This semester we plan on accomplishing the requirements for leaders and parents EXCLUDING emailing and allowing all leaders to have admin privilege to accept requests. We will be doing this for Bobcat, Wolf and Bear requirements.</p>
<p>We will use Yeoman, Bower, and Grunt to help us build and test an AngularJS web application using a NodeJS backend and storing our data in a MySQL database.</p>
