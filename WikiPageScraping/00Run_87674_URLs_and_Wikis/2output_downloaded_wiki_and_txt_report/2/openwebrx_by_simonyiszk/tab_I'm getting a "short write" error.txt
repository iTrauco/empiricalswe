          <p>This is usually an error related to the RTL-SDR, not OpenWebRX.</p>
<p>The steps to debug are the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Unplug the RTL-SDR from the USB port, then plug it in again.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Run the following: <code>rtl_sdr - | csdr through &gt; /dev/null</code></p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You should see the output rate of the RTL-SDR (around 4096000 bytes/s).</p>
<p>Press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop this and exit.</p>

<p>If you don't see this, or see an error message, then there is a problem with the RTL-SDR or mostly the driver is in an inconsistent state (and it wouldn't work with other SDR software either).</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>
<p>If you are still getting a "short write" error message, reboot the computer. This should reset the USB devices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repeat step #2.</p>
</li>
</ol>
