The maker den dashboard listens to the messages from an MQTT Server and displays the values it receives in dials or gauges.
##Architecture
The dashboard uses an MVVM pattern, with the heavy lifting being done by the main view model. The View is a WPF application and makes extensive use of the Telerik WPF controls.</p>
