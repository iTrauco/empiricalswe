          <p>In the emacs world, what does "meta" mean? (edited)</p>
<p>It just means like the Control key</p>
<p>Emacs comes from way back in the days on machines with more buttons</p>
<p>super, meta, ... more I forget</p>
<p>basically in practice on a Mac alt comes bound to Meta</p>
<p>this just means that C-c M-, pronounced "Control see, meta comma", means you hold control and press c, then hold alt and press ,</p>
