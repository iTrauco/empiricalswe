          <p>While developing the generators it's always good to try out your changes before checking them in. Doing so is pretty simple.</p>
<ol>
<li>Ensure that you have removed the <code>generators-aspnet</code> package. To do this you can execute <code>npm uninstall generator-aspnet</code>. If you installed it globally then you should also add the <code>-g</code> option (<em>which in some cases will require <code>sudo</code></em>).</li>
<li>In the <code>generator-aspnet</code> directory execute the command <code>npm link</code>. In some cases you'll have to use <code>sudo npm link</code> depending on configuration.</li>
</ol>
<p>After that you should be able to try out your changes by running <code>yo aspnet</code></p>
<p>Once you are done testing local changes then to undo the configuration above you can execute <code>npm unlink</code>. In many cases <code>npm unlink</code> will not work so you should try the following command to ensure it's gone <code>sudo npm r generator-aspnet -g</code></p>
