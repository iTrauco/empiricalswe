          <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> New 32-bit and 64-bit releases are available <a href="https://github.com/cgrossde/Pullover/releases">here</a>. These should fix all known problems.</p>
<p>If you run into problems, logs can be found in <code>~/.local/share/Pullover</code>.  After authentication, the configuration is placed inside <code>~/.config/pullover/</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Libnotify</strong></p>
<p>You need <code>libnotify</code> for Pullover to work on Linux.</p>
<p>If you have an 64-bit system, make sure you download the <strong>64-bit version</strong> of Pullover, so it can use the 64-bit <code>libnotify</code> system library. If you run the 32-bit Pullover client on a 64-bit system, you would need the 32-bit <code>libnotify</code> library, which can be hard to install. See <a href="https://github.com/cgrossde/Pullover/issues/24">issue #24</a> for more information.</p>
