          <p>#Game Plan!   ^.^</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Add evaluation functions for placing armies, and choosing attack/transfers.</p>
<ul>
<li>(for each country we have, evaluate its need for additional armies (based on defense and attack needs))</li>
<li>(for each country we have, evaluate its ability to attack/the reward for attacking its neighboring region(s))</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use evaluations to decide attacks (transfers are already relatively good)</p>
<ul>
<li>possibly choose transfers based on evaluated need of neighbors for armies (between border states, choose more intelligently)</li>
<li>More intelligently decide number of armies used for attacks.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
