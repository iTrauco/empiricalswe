          <p>In general it looks like there are two formatting conventions for errors and warnings, spelled out below with examples.  I’ve also listed the error codes provided in FVS documentation further below.  The ones in bold and underline are the ones we should be worried about.  The other ones don’t necessarily indicate a problem.  The words “error” and “warning” may show up in different context in the .out file, but don’t indicate a problem with the model run.</p>
<p>Formats:</p>
<ol>
<li>All the warnings and errors with an FVS## are on a new line with 8 *’s followed by 3 spaces and then the FVS## ERROR/WARNING: …
e.g.,</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>********   FVS03 WARNING:  FOREST CODE INDICATES THE GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION IS OUTSIDE THE RANGE OF THE MODEL.  DEFAULT CODE IS USED.
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>The warnings without an FVS## format (I think there may only be two, when too many trees per acre are found, and if no file reference number is used and FVS can’t find the right file to read from or write to) are preceded by two lines of 15 *’s and followed by two lines of 15 *’s.  The warning message itself in between these rows may run for more than one line, but probably begins with WARNING: … not sure about the “NO FILE CONNECTED TO UNIT” error…
e.g.,</li>
</ol>
