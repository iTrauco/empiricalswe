<p>As a site administrator, I want to deploy the latest changes to a private <strong>staging server</strong> in order to keep the production server stable as new features are being developed.</p>
<p>As a group manager, I want to log into a dashboard and <strong>send group membership requests</strong> to users to solicit participation in a grouped forest project.</p>
<p>As a land owner, I want to <strong>receive group membership requests</strong> via email and easily confirm/deny the request through a web interface.</p>
<p>As a land owner who is a member of a carbon aggregation group, I want to <strong>select scenarios to share with the carbon group manager</strong> - a single baseline (max-npv) scenario and a single 'with-project' scenario, both of which will be shared read-only.</p>

<p>As a landowner who is a member of a carbon aggregation group, I want to <strong>see a graph of estimated gross carbon credit yield (# of credits) over time for my property</strong>, based on the carbon accounting rules of the American Carbon Registry's <a href="http://americancarbonregistry.org/carbon-accounting/standards-methodologies/improved-forest-management-ifm-methodology-for-increased-forest-carbon-sequestration-on-u-s-timberlands" rel="nofollow">methodology for Improved Forest Management (IFM) for U.S. Timberlands</a>.</p>
<p>As a group manager, I want to <strong>see a graph or table with the estimated gross carbon credit yield over time for each group member</strong> according to the American Carbon Registry's <a href="http://americancarbonregistry.org/carbon-accounting/standards-methodologies/improved-forest-management-ifm-methodology-for-increased-forest-carbon-sequestration-on-u-s-timberlands" rel="nofollow">methodology for Improved Forest Management (IFM) for U.S. Timberlands</a>.</p>
<p>As a group manager, I want to <strong>find a separate map for each property submitted by group members showing the silvicultural prescriptions applied and timing of harvests in baseline (npv) scenarios</strong> to verify that each baseline scenario is in conformance with state forest practices rules regarding riparian buffers and contiguous clearcut limits.</p>
<p>As a group manager, I want to <strong>see a graph or table with the estimated total gross carbon credit yield over time by my group</strong> according to the American Carbon Registry's <a href="http://americancarbonregistry.org/carbon-accounting/standards-methodologies/improved-forest-management-ifm-methodology-for-increased-forest-carbon-sequestration-on-u-s-timberlands" rel="nofollow">methodology for Improved Forest Management (IFM) for U.S. Timberlands</a>.</p>
<p>As a land owner, I want to see a <strong>net present value calculation</strong> for each of my scenarios in order to quickly compare relative economic values.</p>
<p>As a land owner, I want to see an <strong>automatically generated NPV scenario</strong> to serve as a first approximation for a scenario which maximizes net present value.</p>
