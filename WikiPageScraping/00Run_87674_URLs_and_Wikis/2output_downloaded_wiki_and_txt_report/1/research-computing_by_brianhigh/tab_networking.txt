<div>
<p>In this day and age, it is rare to use a computer without some sort of
network connection, so learning more about the ins and outs of
networking is essential for scientific researchers and other computing
professionals.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The intent of this presentation is to give you a somewhat better
understanding of the basic underpinnings of computer networking as it
relates to Research Computing and Data Management.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>We’ll cover a number of topics including a bit of history of networking,
it’s purpose, the evolution to contemporary computer networks, and many
important technical aspects including networking topologies, protocols
and standards, and networking system components.</p>

were called optical telegraphs.</p>

<div>
<p>The notion of a communications network goes back some time. Think of
smoke signals or drums and later on semaphore and telegraph systems like
Chappe’s that connected European capitals to their frontier defense
posts during Napoleonic times.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Fast forward a bit and you find yourself looking at the electrical
telegraph and telephone all of which were technological improvements but
which would be considered as "analog" technologies. Analog
communications all suffered from problems like ambiguity — "Does that
flag mean attack or retreat?" — and other limitations depending upon
the technology. For example, a semaphore system might only be usable
during periods of clear weather, and sound or smoke traveling over long
distances might be misinterpreted due to audible or visual degradation.</p>

<div>
<p>From the industrial revolution to the early 1900s, things improved
considerably. However, communications systems still suffered from the
limitations of analog technology. While a tin can telephone is a far cry
from the extensive telephone networks that followed, this 1943
switchboard photo depicts a system using the same fundamental
technology.</p>

<div>
<p>What we think of as a computer network really could not arise until
certain preconditions were met and certain technologies discovered. For
one it required the invention of usable computers that employed
binary-based "digital" technology to perform calculations. Secondarily,
it required a realization that binary/digital technologies could be
employed in communication to set the stage for the emergence of computer
networks and networking. Specifically, it wasn’t until the 1960s that
computer networks as we know them really started to take off with
something called "packet switching".</p>

<div>
<p>The essential elements in the binary world is that only two data states
exist — 0 and 1 — yet these can be used to describe incredibly complex
information. It’s importance cannot be over emphasized. However, its
simple use of zeros and of ones can be very difficult for normal mortals
to cope with. Consider the following number. Do you recognize it?</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<pre>128.95.112.1</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Some of you may recognize this number as the address of a server at the
University of Washington that provides so-called domain name services. .</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>How about this number?</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<pre>10000000010111110111000000000001</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>In fact the first number simply a decimal notation representing the
second binary number.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>While speaking in binary won’t make you the hit of the party it is
important to remember that all of our contemporary communications rely
completely on this underlying binary math.</p>

<div>
<p>So, what do computer networks provide? First, they are a means for a
computer system to communicate with another computer system or many
computers systems. I intentionally say "computer system" rather than
"computer" as it is often the case that it is a system running on a
computer that is communicating to peer system, say a specialized system
that performs bank transfer</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Secondarily, networks allow humans to interact with computer systems.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>And lastly, networks allow humans to communicate with other humans…​..
at least for so long as the computers do not rise up and prohibit this.</p>

<div>
<p>Several characteristics define modern computer networking as we know it
today. First is its basis in the binary world that we just reviewed.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Second is a basis in something we have mentioned but not examined and
that is "packet switching".</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The third characteristic is what could generally be called "protocols".</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>One other crucial element in modern computer networking and applications
that run on networked computers is the notion of "layers", We will
review what is generally called a "layered model".</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Other important elements in computer networking include software and
hardware components, network topologies, network speeds, and a number of
other elements.</p>

<div>
<p>In 1865 — the age of telegraphy — the establishment of the
International Telecommunications Union (ITU) signaled the recognition
that worldwide communication would not grow and improve unless countries
cooperated in defining standards and protocols that would allow national
telegram and telephones to interoprate. The ITU is still very much alive
today with governing bodies spanning landline telephone communication,
wireless telephony, satellite communications and many other areas.</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Question</div>
<div>
<p>What is ICANN? IANA?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>It was not always a given, but now that we are well into the age of the
Internet, it is clear that the governing body that has the most to do
with how networking and the Internet as we know them operate is the
Internet engineering task force or IETF. The IETF is the governing body
that has custody of the overall suite of protocols that define the way
that the Internet works. Most notable in this realm is the suite of
Internet protocols that go by the name of TCP/IP. While not necessarily
part of the Internet, many other organizations and institutions operate
networks that use the same TCP/IP suite to implement their networks. The
core protocols of this suite include transmission control protocol and
Internet protocol both of which are featured in the suite’s name and
which govern routing on what we now call an Internet-based network. The
suite includes under its umbrella many other protocols that support
operations on an Internet-based network these include protocols to look
up names you may — may recognize DNS in that role — and things like time
synchronization handled by the protocol NTP or network time protocol.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>TCP/IP protocols and their changes and enhancements are embodied in
documents call RFCs, or Request For Comment. In technical discussions,
it is not unusual to hear networking types use phrases like "RFC 1918
addressing" to reference a specific technical subject.</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Question</div>
<div>
<p>How many different protocols are under the TCP/IP umbrella?</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<p>Many factors are considered in the development of these complicated
protocols including what degree of reliability is required what
performance is required. Some protocols may include elements that are
unreliable by design and are simply called unreliable. It is not an
insult but a very practical decision of trade-offs to allow a certain
degree of unreliability in the name of better performance and the the
converse can be true.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>To the amusement of some, many of the key protocols begin with the term
"Simple" when they are hardly that.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Before looking any more closely at protocols it will help to back up a
bit and look at other defining aspect of "inter-networking" in the form
of the layered model mentioned earlier and at packet switching. Let us
look at the basics of packet switching first.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p>Imagine, if you will, Charles Dickens sitting at Gad’s Hill, Kent writing
<em>A Tale of Two Cities</em> one paragraph at a time. He’s doing it this way
because the only way he has to send his prose to the publisher is on the
back of a stack of postcards one card at a time. At a very basic level
this represents how a packet switching network operates, by reducing a
larger message or text to small postcard sized packets which are then
transmitted individually.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Now, you might ask, how will Dickens' postcards get to the publisher in
London if one of the bridges over the Thames is out of service, or if a
certain post office along the route is closed for the day or has burned
down. The logical answer might be that the postcards should be sent over
a different bridge and through a different post office. This can be seen
to represent another important component of packet switched networking,
that of "routing".</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Now put yourself in the shoes of the publisher. Hundreds of new
postcards have arrived from Dickens but they have come across different
bridges and through different post offices and it’s not really obvious
what the order of these postcards are is supposed to be of whether any
postcards might be missing. Some of the postcards are obviously damaged
or smeared. In fact the first part card reads "A Tale of [illegible]
Cities" and the second "it was the winter of our discontent". What is
the publisher to make of this text?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>These issues are all something that packet switched networking must
address. Routing, address resolution, sequencing, and checking for
completeness.</p>
</div>

</div>
<hr/>
<div>
<p>This diagram is a very simple example of network routing that
simply shows how traffic may choose another path through the network in
the event a device along the path has failed. The protocols that we will
talk about a little later are essential to making sure that, regardless
of the route, the data transmission is successful and copes with any
variables along the way.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>There are quite a number of other elements and terms that are essential
to routing but I’ll mention just a few of them here including hops,
latency, congestion, queuing and metrics. Let’s take a quick tour
through all five terms.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>"Hops" are mostly an indicator of how many network routing devices are
given packet must pass through to reach its destination.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>"Latency" is a measure of call it lateness — delayed transmission (and
its reception) over the network — especially over long distances.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>"Congestion" is more or less a measure of just how much traffic is on
the road so to speak. Think of daily traffic on Interstate 5 as it ebbs
and flows and slows in response to congestion. Inter-networks aren’t much
different.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>"Queuing" is essentially a positive component of most networks that
allow data packets (or cars!) To get where they are going by imposing
certain rules of queuing and by implementing controls to enforce those
rules. Think of the light controlled on ramps on Interstate 5. Of course
for queuing to be effective you must have someplace for packets or cars
to queue up like the entrance ramp off of 45th street. In the network
world devices that participate in routing traffic include queuing
capacity by design so that packets have a better chance of reaching
their destination expeditiously even if there is some delay involved.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>"Metrics" are something that are implemented in routing protocols that
consider a lot of the other factors we have just discussed — queuing,
congestion, latency, hops — and make calculated decisions about the
best way to send packets on their way. If you had to drive from the UW
campus to Edmonds right now, you would have a choice of routes. Take I-5
Or Highway 99? And you would likely consider pretty much the same list
of factors as these "routing metrics".</p>

<div>
<p>Protocols and jargon beget more protocols and jargon. If we suggested
that you go to 128.95.230.32 to work on RStudio, it might be hard to
remember your intended destination. Instead, we are able to say go to
"phage" or "phage.deohs.washington.edu". This is made possible by a
resolution protocol system called the domain name system or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System" rel="nofollow">DNS</a> with
which many of you are likely familiar.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Further, resolution is required not simply to that IP address, but to an
actual hardware device in the computer and to something called a MAC
(media access control) address. This
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address" rel="nofollow">MAC address</a> is something that
is equally unfriendly to humans consisting as it does of a string of
hexadecimal numbers. Resolving an IP address to a specific computer and
its MAC address required another protocol called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_Resolution_Protocol" rel="nofollow">ARP</a> or address
resolution protocol. But we may be drifting into the realm of that
protocol called <a href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=TMI" rel="nofollow">TMI</a>.</p>

<div>
<p>To bring more conceptual order to this complicated set of protocols, a
layered model is used as a reference. Take a look at this diagram. While
there are other layered models in the communications world, the TCP/IP
model aimed for some simplicity in comparison to others, with only 4
layers (other popular models such as the OSI Model have more). Probably
the most frequently referred to protocol in the suite is IP or the
Internet protocol which deals with what would be called an IP address
and which is also fundamental to the operation of routing across an IP
network.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>It is not so important for you to remember a lot of details about the
great number of protocols employed, but we review this information with
an eye towards helping you learn how to troubleshoot problems you may
have using a networked computer. More on that later.</p>

<p>Let’s look the flow of data through the layer TCP/IP model. You can see
that data originates in the highest level of the model, the application
layer and is handed off to the transport layer then next to the Internet
layer and then down to the link, or physical layer. After passing across
a network, the data is then sent up through the layered model in reverse
order. This is how all Internet communications operate.</p>

<div>
<p>The importance of the layered model operation makes a bit more sense
when you consider another fundamental operation of IP networks, that of
encapsulation. While some of this attractive diagram has not been
translated from the Dutch it should be pretty straightforward to see
where we have an application layer where information is transformed into
packets of binary data for encapsulation by the transport layer then
again encapsulated into the Internet layer format and so on until the
data is finally encapsulated for transmission over the link layer of
data network.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Using our Charles Dickens example, it would be as if Dickens ran out of
postcards but discovered a cache of envelopes. Think of encapsulation as
a layer of envelopes around chapters of his long tale.</p>

<div>
<p>Let’s quickly review a few other key elements of contemporary computer
networks.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The term LAN for "local area network" means pretty much what it says it
is the local network that you are connected to and routing does not
necessarily occur except to make connections to other LANs. Connections
to other computers on the local area network are handled more by
protocols like ARP.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The term WAN for "wide area network" refers to a collection of networks
tied together across a wide area and where elements like routing become
more important.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>The distinction is not often absolute.</p>
</div>
<div>
<div>
<div>Question</div>
<div>
<p>Is the UW network a WAN?<sup>[<a href="#_footnote_1" id="user-content-_footnoteref_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup></p>

<div>
<p>Network equipment can be organized in different so-called topologies.
Common examples include mesh, hub and spoke (star), and bus. The
Internet can be considered the biggest example going of a mesh network.
Closer to home, a star topology is more likely to be found on a local
area network (LAN).</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Mesh, Star, and Tree are arguably more common in this era</p>

<p>At this point in the history of computer networking it could seem that

layer 2 networking and switching. While that is not the case, for
practical purposes it might as well be considered so. Competing
protocols have come but mostly gone.</p>

<p>Ethernet has continuously evolved, from a bus-based system in the 1980s
to Ethernet utilizing twisted-pair cabling and the familiar RJ45
connector, and can connect over a variety of copper, fiber, and
wireless/radio media. All brought to us by another important standards
body, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.</p>

<div>
<p>While not restricted to local area network technology, network speeds
are referred to in bits per second — bps — with variations based on the
speed of the network. Probably most familiar is the term megabits
(million bits) per second — Mbps. Speeds have progressed from 10 Mbps,
past 100 Mbps, and now range into "gigabit" or billion bits per second — Gbps.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Take note that the letter B in"bps" is expressed in lower case where a
bit is simply one binary digit. Contrast this with "MB" for megabyte
where a byte is an unit consisting of 8 bits. This distinction becomes
important when trying to calculate the time needed to transfer data over
a network where the network speed is expressed and measured in some
number of bits per second but the data to be transferred is stated in
megabytes</p>

<div>
<p>So, what are the devices that make these complex topologies work?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Two types of devices, perhaps familiar, provide the functionality needed
for a packet switched network. The first would be a "switch". The second
is known as a router. The former is typically implemented to support a
LAN while the latter is intended to provide routing services for a WAN.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Another device with which you are probably familiar is a wireless access
point.</p>

<div>
<p>First keep in mind that a network is only as good as its weakest or
slowest link. Network service can be a performance bottleneck in some
situations.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>A wired connection to your computer is almost always more reliable than
a wireless network connection.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In the case of bottlenecks remember that read and write speed to and
from a local hard drive will typically always be faster than the speed
of read and write to share or folder on the network.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>What are some troubleshooting techniques?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>For one start with the component closest to you and work your ways
outward. Troubleshooting what seems like an Internet problem may be
nonproductive if it is simply the case that someone has unplugged your
network cable from the wall.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Learn how to use a simple tool called "ping" to assess whether remote
network hosts are reachable by IP address.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Get a grip on name resolution and DNS. Knowing whether a problem is
simply a failure of domain name resolution can save you a lot of time
and aggravation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Learn how to determine your IP address using tools on your computer or
web based tools like <a href="https://www.whatismyip.com/" rel="nofollow">whatismyIP.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Whether you are attempting to solve a problem by yourself or wind up
seeking help from another party, knowing some of these techniques will
help get you back in action much more quickly.</p>
