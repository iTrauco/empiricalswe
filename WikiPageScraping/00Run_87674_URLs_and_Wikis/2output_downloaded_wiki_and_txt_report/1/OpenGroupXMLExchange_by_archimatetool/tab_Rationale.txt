<p>The exchange format is a mechanism that attempts to package an ArchiMate model from a tool in XML so that it can be conveyed to another tool with as much information as possible about the model, given that ArchiMate is not really formalised in the same way as, say, UML. It attempts to package those things described in the narrative of the ArchiMate specification and what actually happens in the real world of ArchiMate tools. As such, there is always going to be a "lowest common denominator" effect. It aims to support the exchange of the core components of ArchiMate plus some additional constructs such as Properties.</p>

<li>ArchiMate elements</li>
<li>ArchiMate relationships</li>
<li>Properties/Attributes</li>
<li>Views (phase 2)</li>

<ul>
<li>A user wishes to import their ArchiMate models into another tool preserving as much information as possible.</li>
<li>A user wishes to process their models using XSLT to transform the XML into reports.</li>
<li>A learning organization wishes to establish a repository of searchable ArchiMate models in order to provide examples of best practice and patterns.</li>
<li>ArchiMate and EA students and learners using different tools wish to share their models.</li>
</ul>

<p>The XML exchange format packages the core components into flat lists. There is a flat list of elements, of relations, of property definitions and of Views (phase 2). Why flat lists? Hierarchical organization of elements typically is tool-dependent. This usually manifests as some kind of tree or folder based organizational aspect. Each tool will probably have its own system. Therefore core components are packaged into flat lists. An additional (optional)  element is provided so that vendors can reference the elements and relations by IDs into  structures should they feel that this information is important. An importing tool, or processing agent, may choose to ignore this organizational information if it has no meaning to them, or may wish to use it in whichever way they choose.</p>
