          <p>It is the one of the most frequently asked question. When you try to save settings or first time setup page you got 404 or some another error.</p>
<p>We did some investigation and found that the cause is mostly connected to Apache mod_security module which goes with some hosting/server plans by the default. <a href="http://www.modsecurity.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.modsecurity.org/</a></p>
<p>The module has settings called Rules that are monitoring the access requests to your site. If mod_security rule decides that request data or URL or something else is dangerous on their opinion then it throws error preventing further access to the site.</p>
<p>The problem is that rules can be customized the way nobody expects. We cannot change the way setting are saving to satisfy any mod_security rule.</p>
<p>That is happening with invoice save settings action for some hosting/server plans. e.g. DreamHost, GoDaddy.</p>
<p>The only way to fix that is to contact hosting provider to see mod_security logs for details that will help to determine which rule is fired for your case and try to fix it or turn off.</p>
<p>Also to get around this, you can temporarily disable mod_security, configure your WP-Invoice setup, and then re-enable mod_security. The easiest way to temporarily disable mod_security is to create an .htaccess file in the document root of the web server with the following contents:</p>
<pre><code>SecFilterEngine Off
SecFilterScanPOST Off
</code></pre>
<p>Save that file and restart Apache. After you take care of the final setup of WP-Invoice, make sure to delete or rename that .htaccess file and restart Apache. If you don't remove that file and restart the server, Apache will be wide open and insecure.  Remember: don't forget to turn mod_security back on.</p>
<p>We guarantee that our code doesn't do any dangerous actions. It just posts the data to be saved.</p>
