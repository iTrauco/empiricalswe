<p>Carb Sync V2 operation</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Follow the recommended carb sync method for your bike. These instructions
assume that you know how to prepare and adjust your bike.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The sensors have a 3mm port. A 1/8 inch ID tube works great. You will need
a plastic reducing coupler to connect to a tube that fits your bike. Yamaha
uses 5mm. A 3/16” ID tube works great. Honda uses a 6mm port. A 1/4” ID
tube works great. Some makes and models vary. Make a set of tubes that are
consistent. It doesn't matter which size tube is longer but do cut,
build and hook-up everything the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With your bike prepared for sync, hook up your tubes to the carbs and the
sensors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>With the bike NOT RUNNING connect the device to the dc power source you are
using, or if it is already powered on, press the reset button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Wait for the calibration sequence to complete. OPTIONAL: press the reset
again to ensure all sensors are warmed up and stable. This is really not
needed but looks important.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is normal for the calibration to set the sensor readout within a point
or two of each other. If all sensors are reading the same that means
someone did a really good job soldering it all together and everything is
in ideal condition. For the rest of us, just note the relative settings
when the bike is off. The Digital Carb Sync Shield is designed to be
forgiving to build quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>START THE BIKE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Follow the bike's owners manual to adjust the carbs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Get the readings as close to each other as you can. A few points difference
is fine. The sensors are more accurate than needed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is okay to open up the throttle but remember that if your vacuum advance
is disconnected the bike may miss at higher rpms.</p>
</li>
</ol>
