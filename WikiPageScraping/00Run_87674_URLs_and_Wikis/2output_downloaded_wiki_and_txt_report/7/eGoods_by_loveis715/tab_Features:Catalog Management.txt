          <p>Products on eGoods should be categorized. A good category system will bring a lot of benefits to user:</p>
<ol>
<li>User could perform a search without typing. One mouse click is enough.</li>
<li>Help to increase accuracy, avoid incorrect character input.</li>
<li>Bring hints to users</li>
<li>Standardized category helps to form users’ habit</li>
</ol>
<p>Besides these, categories also bring benefits to the whole system:</p>
<ol>
<li>Allows users to quickly find categorized products, without any search. Searches in huge amount of products are expensive. Besides this, there’s also possibility that users could not find his proposed products in only few searches. A good category system could help to standardize user’s action and bring benefits for some enhancement solutions.</li>
<li>More hints. Users’ requirement varies with time. A girl may want a skirt in summer, but none in winter.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our category system provides the following functionalities:</p>
<ol>
<li>Each category can contain sub-categories. If one product belongs to one category, it must belong one of the sub-category.</li>
<li>One category contains a name, reference to parent and all children.</li>
<li>Allows administrators to CRUD categories.</li>
<li>When creating a category, we can not only specify its parent, but also specify all its children.</li>
<li>When retrieving a category, the entity will also contain links to all its children and its parent.</li>
<li>When updating a category, we can update the category itself, and also add/remove its children, update its parent.</li>
<li>When deleting a category, we will also delete all its children.</li>
<li>User can list all categories from root or all descendant categories as a sub-tree.</li>
<li>When searching for one category, we should include all products for all its sub-categories. The algorithm affects performance: We may have separate caches for one category and its sub-categories, but this may significantly increase the memory usage.</li>
