          <p>The CFITSIO library supports several types of compression algorithms for FITS
images.  When dividing imagery into [SQUID tiles](SQUID Index) compression is
vital to ensure that partially populated tiles don't use unnecessary disk space.
The CFITSIO library is able to operate on compressed images in a manner transparent
to the user.  Compressed images are read and written just as if they were uncompressed.
CFITSO currently supports 4 types of compression algorithms; Rice, GZIP, HCompress, and PLIO.
The Rice, GZIP, and PLIO algorithms are all lossless while the HCompress algorithm
can be either lossless or lossy.
The [squidfits](LibSQUID FITS) utility currently uses the Rice compression algorithm
by default, but can be modified to use any of the compression algorithms supported
by CFITSIO.  The plot below shows a comparison between the Rice, GZIP, and HCompress
algorithms on SQUID tile images with various levels of coverage.<br/>
