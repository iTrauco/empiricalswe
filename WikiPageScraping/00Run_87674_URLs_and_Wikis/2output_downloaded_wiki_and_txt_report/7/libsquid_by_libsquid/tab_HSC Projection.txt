<p>The HEALPix spherical cube projection (HSC) is a hybrid between Lambert's Cylindrical equal area projection for the equator and a Collignon projection for the polar faces.  The resulting projection is a pseudo-quadcube that is equiareal.  The line of latitude that divides the equatorial region from the polar region is asin(2/3) or approximately 41.81 degrees, rather than the 45 deg dividing line for the true quad-cube projections.  The HSC projection is very simple, especially in the equatorial region where x=lon and y=sin(lat).  The polar regions are somewhat more complex, but not significantly worse.  The polar regions do suffer from similar discontinuities to the [QSC Projection](QSC Projection).  Lines of latitude are displayed as straight lines which abruptly turn 90 deg when they encounter a diagonal.  Nevertheless, the HSC projection provides a very simple way to arrive at an equal area projection with minimal computational effort.</p>
<p>The formulas for the computation of the HSC Projection were taken from Gorski (2005) and
Calabretta (2007), see <a href="References">References</a></p>
