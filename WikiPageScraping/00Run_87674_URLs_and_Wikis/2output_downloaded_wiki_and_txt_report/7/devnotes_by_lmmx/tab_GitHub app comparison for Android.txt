<ul>
<li>I'm looking for a GitHub app that will let me edit the Wiki of a repo, but am not sure if such a feature is implemented anywhere.</li>
<li>There is an open question which I will seek to address (asked ~2 months ago), on a method to sync the Wiki of a repo with its content
<ul>
<li>A comment which the author rejected was just "GitHub Pages solves this". It's wrong (doesn't solve the <em>getting content from Wiki to main repo</em> problem), but does actually point to a compelling application of such synchronisation (using a Wiki as a general purpose website editor for a Jekyll site). A solution could therefore be of broad community interest (Jekyll/GH Pages is popular, and Jekyll 3.0 has brought <a href="https://github.com/lmmx/devnotes/wiki/Use-Jekyll-3-with-GitHub-Pages"><em>Collections</em></a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To search for this feature I may as well just download all the available apps (at time of writing, Sunday July 24 2016) and note down a comparison in the table below</li>
</ul>
<p>update: oops I never got around to writing the table! I used Gitskarios, but then I think it became no longer maintained as of 2017! (No longer using an Android GitHub app)</p>
