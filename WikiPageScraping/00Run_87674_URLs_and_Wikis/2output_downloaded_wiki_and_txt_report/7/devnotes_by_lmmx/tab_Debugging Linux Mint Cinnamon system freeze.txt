<p>Last happened half an hour earlier, playing an hour long video, Chrome with a few windows open. Apparently Xorg log can show which application caused the freeze.</p>
<p>Intel i7, see <code>lspci</code> for more details on driver specs.</p>
<p><code>cat /var/log/Xorg.0.log</code> to see X window manager details. <code>accelmethod</code> in the conf somewhere? (no <code>...intel-conf</code> as suggested)</p>

<p><em>Maybe of note: was using a gif as a screensaver of sorts, left it open. Are unviewed tabs still rendered âˆ´ able to take up graphics power?</em></p>
<p><strong>Next occurrence:</strong> No VLC open (I'm pretty sure), just a few pdf's (evince) and a handful of Chrome tabs.</p>
<ul>
<li>No log messsage...</li>
<li>Seemingly only logs a message in the instances of a temporary freeze. In this case it wasn't able to get out of it, and had to be hard reset [power off] - no idea where to look but <code>drm stuck on render ring</code> gives some hint</li>
