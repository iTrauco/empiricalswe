<li>These docs are... very <del>bad</del>...unhelpful. Almost <em>don't ask</em> level annoying but for the record [after wasting far too much time on this needless confusion]:
<ul>
<li>Links do not match their titles in the RHS e.g. 'trusty' will not point to that distro version</li>
<li>Allegedly updated but the version numbers don't extend to a mid-2015 range so clearly needs someone who understands this to go in and relink up the relevant pages.
<ul>
<li>ðŸ˜‘ Even the links that are there don't have pages associated with them (unlike Wikipedia they appear indistinguishable from 'live' links)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is no 'more info' button and the 'system report' does not show this 'model number' (as far as I can see) so run <code>sysctl hw.model</code>
