          <p>The best we can do is to apply some strategies with the tools that CSS provides to increase the probability that our components will display with the intended styling. In other words, we want to create CSS selectors that will most likely have the highest priority of matching just the elements in our components.</p>
<p>If style encapsulation is a concern, then a thorough understanding of CSS selector priority is necessary, but beyond the scope of this book. However, what is relevant to mention here is that styles that are in-lined with an element or selectors post-fixed with “!important” generally win. The highest probability that a selector will be applied is one that is in-lined and has “!important” post-fixed. For up to a few style rules this can be used. But it becomes impractical for many rules.</p>
<p>For maintaining a component style sheet, the suggestion would be to use a unique class or ID namespace for the top level element of the component and post fix the rules with “!important”. ID namespaces provide a higher priority over class, but can only be used in situations where there will never be more than one component in a document such as a global page header or footer. The namespace will prevent component CSS from bleeding out of the component’s boundaries especially when “!important” is also used.</p>
<p>The final challenge in attempts to provide thorough style encapsulation is that of accounting for all the possible rules that can affect the presentation of any element in a component. If thoroughness is necessary, a good strategy is to inspect all the componen telements with a browser’s web developer tools. Chrome, Safari, and Firefox allow you to see what all the computed styles are for an element whether the applied style rules are from a style sheet or are the browser default. Often the list can be quite long, but not all the rules necessarily affect what needs to be presented to the visitor.</p>
