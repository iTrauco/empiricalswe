          <p><em>Resource limits only apply to the GP-DREAM server, obviously there are no limits when [running modules locally](Why local is better) on your computer.</em></p>
<p><strong>The need for strict limits</strong><br/>
When you start a module from GP-DREAM, a job is dispatched to the computing cluster of the Broad Institute. Compute time and memory are costly resources shared with researchers at the Broad as well as all other GP-DREAM users. Network inference can be computationally very intensive, so we have to put strict limits on runtime and memory in place to avoid that our queue can get clogged by a single user launching demanding jobs. Even with resource limits in place, it's very important to be mindful of other users. For heavy use, it's much better to [run modules locally](Why local is better).</p>
<p><strong>Why the limits are different for each module</strong><br/>
For each module, we set the time and memory limits such that it successfully completes when run with the DREAM5 challenge datasets and default parameters. For larger datasets or different parameter settings, the given resources may not be sufficient and the module should be run locally.</p>
<p><strong>What to do when resources are insufficient</strong><br/>
You need to [install and run the module locally](Why local is better) on your computer, or change the parameter settings (e.g., reduce the number of bootstrap runs).</p>
<p><strong>The hour and week queues</strong><br/>
Modules that have a runtime of less than an hour for the DREAM5 datasets are dispatched to the hour queue and all other modules to the week queue. These are two different queues on the Broad cluster. Jobs in the hour queue have higher priority and thus tend to have a shorter wait time until they start.</p>
<p><strong>Reasons why your job may take a long time to complete</strong><br/>
The Broad cluster may be busy and your job is waiting in the queue (do not launch the job a second time, this will only further clog the queue). Wait times can range from few seconds up to several days. Wait time tends to be much shorter for modules that are dispatched to the hour queue. Unfortunately, it is currently not possible to view the cluster load or expected wait times. To avoid wait time, we recommend that you [run modules locally](Why local is better).</p>

<p>Here's an overview of the resource limits and average runtime for each module. The runtimes were measured on the DREAM5 datasets with default parameters and do not include wait times in the queue (i.e., your jobs may take longer to complete if they get hold up in the queue).</p>
