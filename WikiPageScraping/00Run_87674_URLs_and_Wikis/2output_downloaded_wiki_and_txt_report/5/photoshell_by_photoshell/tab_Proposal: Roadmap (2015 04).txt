          <p>Current roadmap as I see it:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/photoshell/photoshell/issues/155">#155</a> Decide on how the esarch / CLI actions work (the CLI in my mind is basically just our search syntax outside of a UI)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/photoshell/photoshell/issues/122">#122</a> Decouple core logic from the UI (designing our internal methods to work based on the principles outlined in the previous step, eg. selection objects, selectors, etc.)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/photoshell/photoshell/issues/53">#53</a>, <a href="https://github.com/photoshell/photoshell/issues/54">#54</a> Design keyboard shortcuts and touch interactions (more generally, define a system that maps certain keyboard / touch interactions to search/selection actions so that we don't have a bunch of random keyboard logic floating all over the code)</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/photoshell/rawphoto/issues/9">rawphoto#9</a> Make rawphoto a libraw wrapper (or whatever we decide to do there)</li>
</ul>
<p>Once these things are done we can get back to making new features, but I think we shouldn't go too much farther without this restructure.</p>
