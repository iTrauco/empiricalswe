<p>Katana, is a fork of <a href="https://www.kde.org/" rel="nofollow">K Desktop Environment</a> (KDE) with emphasis on efficiency. So far it has proven to be roughly 50% less system resource hungry and significantly faster.</p>

<p>Since most of the focus is towards KDE Frameworks (KDE5) now and there is little going on on the KDE4 side we decided that it would be a good time to start cleaning up the project, cut the fat and make it more usable on not so powerful systems. Having said that there are a lot of changes done so far which remove as little functionality as possible for the benefit of better overall performance. Most of the changes are internal and it is unlikely that you would miss what we undid.</p>
<p>KDE developing practices are good but they tend not to break compatibility which means that the existing code can not always take advantage of all the goodies the modern software ecosystem offers. For an example, LibArchive supports variaty of compression formats and is used on some sub-projects (Ark) but not in the core (kdelibs) which means duplication of code (read time and money) for something that can be achieved far easier and less painful. But for this to happen <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface" rel="nofollow">APIs</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface" rel="nofollow">ABIs</a> must be broken - KTar, KZip and friends can be removed and KArchive taking advantage of LibArchive would be the way to go.</p>
<p>But that rises another question - why not take advantage of Qt5 and contribute to KDE5 instead. Well, KDE4 fits pretty well for use on existing systems and it will take quite some time before KDE5 gets as mature as KDE4, meanwhile we shall keep and maintain the best of KDE4.</p>

<p>First, you must understand how forking a big project works. There is a lot of rebranding involved and to keep this to the minimum the name "Katana" was chosen thus we do not have to change every reference to "KDE". As you already may have guessed it you can refer to Katana as <b>K</b>atana <b>D</b>esktop <b>E</b>nvironment.</p>

<p>Yes, altought there may be some areas to improve and bugs to fix it should be stable and not cause any major headaches. If it does, please, <a href="https://github.com/fluxer/katana/issues">report</a> your issues. We highly recommend you to check if your problem is reproducable with the latest version first, that means that you will have to build from the latest commit on the master branch of all repositories. To do that just follow the <a href="https://github.com/fluxer/katana/wiki/Building-and-installing">build instructions</a>.</p>

<p>There isn't really. Releases are issued when several major improvements have been made, enough testing is done and so on. Mostly minor releases are made (e.g. 4.18.0) not micro/patch releases. Important patches are published for the latest <a href="https://github.com/fluxer/katana/releases">release</a> as an update, if you are packaging Katana for a distribution we recommend watching the repository to get notifed when they are added as part of a release. If that does not fit your personal preferences you can always pull the latest source and build it yourself, you will be surprised how easy it can be and you may learn a thing or two in the process.</p>

<p>That depends, it will require more people to be involved and additional effort. If there is need for such you can become an advisor and review patches from the on-going development branches of the project. Tags can be created for each repository for convenience to easy the testing of patches, contact us and we will see what we can do about it.</p>

<p>First of all, it does not support Windows and Mac as KDE does with BSD being partially supported (some functionality has not been tested yet and it's not very easy due to lack of hardware support, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardware_acceleration" rel="nofollow">hardware acceleration</a> for one). The goal is to support some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix" rel="nofollow">UNIX</a>-like Operating Systems, such as Linux and the BSD family. In terms of source compatibility most KDE applications should work with Katana after minor adjustments but anything not shipped as part of our releases you should use at your own considerations. Source compatibility between releases is not guaranteed but the aim is to maintain most of it, we do not guarantee binary compatibility and encourage full rebuild when a new release is made.</p>

Why distributions do not ship it?</h1>
<p>That bad part about forking a project is that you have to put a lot of effort into renaming and rebranding the software which is complex task. It requires many internal and external changes which will affect users and as such it has not been done yet, for an example your (probably) favourite file manager would no longer be branded as Dolphin to avoid conflicts with KDE4/KDE5 and if you expect to find Dolphin in your menu after installing Katana it will not be there under the same name if the total rebranding happens.</p>
<p>As such it is expected that you understand that currently KDE4, KDE5 and Katana cannot be installed on the same system without installation in different than the standard <em>/usr</em> or <em>/usr/local</em> prefix. While t is possible to package it in <em>/opt/kde4</em>, distributions rarely do that (Arch Linux package maintainers did it for their staging KDE5 packages) even if it complies with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard" rel="nofollow">Filesystem Hierarchy Standard</a> (see Add-on application software packages, Rationale, paragraph 4). <em>/opt</em> is being used mostly for proprietary software by them. That is why the build script (build.sh) in the main Katana repository exist and should be used to compile and install the project into prefix of your choice, optionally specified by you as command line argument. How to run it later is also noted from the same script.</p>

What's going on?</h1>
<p>That's a problem noticed when the official nVidia driver is used, give it a shot with the open-source drivers (nouveau/nv). Also, bare in mind that plasmoids (desktop and tray applets) mostly use declarative interface and they are quite resource consuming.</p>
<p>If the behaviour is observed from a Live CD/DVD/USB image that is because Plasma used to (but not in 4.19.0 and newer) store rendering caches to disk in addition to RAM. This makes the cache use twice as much as it should in such environments because they use temporary storage (tmpfs/aufs/overlayfs) that uses the system RAM instead of an actual disk (USB/HDD). The biggest caches were two of ~80MB each and they used to be stored as <em>/var/tmp/kdecache-&lt;username&gt;/*.kcache</em> (usually). That means that ~160MB were wasted immediately after KDE was started in such environment.</p>

<p>Yes, you can. <a href="https://github.com/fluxer/katana/wiki/TODO">There</a> are various task you can help with but since the project is in early stages there isn't a good infrastructure for doing so. At the moment your options, for an example, for translating the sub-projects are limited, you will have to work directory with the .po files. There are no mailing lists and other goodies so just fork and make pull requests.</p>

<p>Implement it yourself, pay someone else to do it or just deal with it. Some changes such as Wayland support require great amount of time and effort to maintain and lack support from the backbone - Qt4. Katana makes use of many other open source project which you have to get to know and consider improving those first. As an example if Ark does not have support for some archive type which can be implemented in libarchive then there is no need to make a CLI plugin for it and the changes to Ark itself will be minimal.</p>
