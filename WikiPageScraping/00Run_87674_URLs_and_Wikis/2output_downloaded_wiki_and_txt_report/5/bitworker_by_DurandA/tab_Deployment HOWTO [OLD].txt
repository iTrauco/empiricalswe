          <p>In order to use drttor.jar you should ensure that :</p>
<ol>
<li>You have the C:\rainbowcrack-1.5-win64 folder containing the rcrack software.</li>
<li>You have the C:\tmp folder. The rainbow tables are created there.</li>
</ol>
<p>To launch drttor.jar use the command line :
java -jar .\drttor.jar  (for example java -jar .\drttor.jar .\md5_loweralpha-numeric_1-5.rtorrent)
Rainbow table parts are created in the current directory. If pieces *.rt are already present in the working directory, rcrack will skip regeneration and drttor will use it as piece content.</p>
