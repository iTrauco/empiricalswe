          <p>Setup and Options File</p>
<p>Unpack downloaded file. It will generate a directory called <tt>hycud-<i>[version]</i></tt> which would be <tt>hycud-3.3.1</tt> for version 3.3.1. In your home directory create a directory <tt>.hycud</tt> and copy the file <tt>Options.py</tt> from the hycud directory to this newly created directory. You may edit <tt>Options.py</tt> in the directory <tt>.hycud</tt> to set where HYCUD can find REMO, and HydroPro, as well as where to put it's temporary files.</p>
<p>Please don't edit the file in the hycud directory, since HYCUD will update the options file in your home directory if new options are added with a newer version. Any changes in the Options.py file included with HYCUD will be overridden by the one in your home directory.</p>
<p>Change the line: <tt>default_calcHydr = "<b>hydropro10-lnx.exe</b>"</tt> to the path where the HydroPro executable can be found (only change the bold part). Once this is done, the --exe option does not need to be specified anymore.</p>
<p>Change the line: <tt>default_REMOdir = "<b>/nmr5/nare/programs/REMO</b>"</tt> to the directory where REMO can be found. Once this is done, the --REMOdir (or -R) option does not need to be specified anymore.</p>
<p>If you want HYCUD to put it's temporary files into a special directory you can edit the line <tt>default_temporaryStorage = "<b>.</b>"</tt>.</p>
