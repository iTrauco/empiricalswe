<p>#Everything Works!#</p>
<p><strong>01/06/2015</strong> -- Ordered a couple enclosures for the temp/humidity sensor nodes. See the sensor node and cost page for info.  Hope to get them soon since they are coming from Kentucky.</p>
<p><strong>01/03/2015</strong> -- Getting used to openHAB configuration. I have basic temp and humidity displaying for ground floor kitchen and master bath. I have I spent quite a lot of time just getting Yahoo! weather to display correctly. You have to create transforms for each individual element you want to display. It's a bit of a pain, but once you figure it out it works pretty well. I'm now checking my openHAB server for today and tomorrow's weather. Also have some charting working. This will all come in handy with displaying sensor information.</p>
<p><strong>01/02/2015</strong> -- I have the Moteinos working in prototype/breadboard mode. I have 2 temp/humidity (DHT11) sensors that are sending data to the RFM gateway. That in turn sends the info (publishes) to the Mosquitto server. The openHAB server then subscribes to the various "topics" and outputs the information in openHAB.</p>
