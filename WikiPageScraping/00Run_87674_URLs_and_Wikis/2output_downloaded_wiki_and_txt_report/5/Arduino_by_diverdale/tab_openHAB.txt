          <p>#openHAB Install and Configuration#</p>
<p>I had some issues understanding some of the config files with openHAB. I will attempt to document them here. I was not that familiar with XSL prior to this, so that may be part of the issue ;)</p>
<p>I spent quite a bit of time working with getting the Yahoo! weather working properly. I know it's not really monitoring but it's good learning for the XSL transforms. I plan on getting different icons and possibly other tweaks to the presentation.Here's a screenshot of the detailed screen. The charts that are chopped off are current temp / forecast high / forecast low on one chart and wind speed on the other.</p>
