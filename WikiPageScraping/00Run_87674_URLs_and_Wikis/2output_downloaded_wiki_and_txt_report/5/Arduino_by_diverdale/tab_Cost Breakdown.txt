          <p>#How Much Has it Cost Me?#</p>
<p>Well, I opted for the Moteino with the soldered on RFM69HW and the flash chip. The RFM69HW is $7.00 and the flash chip is $3.00. This brings the total per Moteino to $23.95.  Not extremely expensive but not too cheap either.  It's worth it for me to get something that small and already have the communication chip taken care of.</p>
<p>Here's the breakdown:</p>
<pre><code>Description               Price        Qty       Total 
--------------            -------       ----      --------
* Moteino complete        -- $23.95         2         $47.90
* Arduino Uno R3          -- $24.95         2         $49.90
* Arduino Ethernet Shield -- $10.96         1         $10.96
* DHT-11 Temp Sensor      -- $5.00          3         $15.00
* Door Sensor             -- $3.95          3         $11.85
* RFM69HW xponder         -- $6.95          2         $13.90
* PING sensor             -- $5.00          1         $5.00
* Hall Effect sensor      -- $2.00          2         $4.00
* PIR sensor              -- $10.00         1         $10.00

                                        Total -- $168.51
                      
----------------- Future Purchases ---------------------------

* Waterproof temp sensor   -- $9.95         1         $9.95

<p>That's it so far...minus some dupont cables and other testing stuff that I've had or needed. I will start by running the openHAB and Mosquitto on my Mac at home. Eventually, I'll move to dedicated system. RasPi or something else.  Also intend on getting Android tablet to run in single app mode for openHAB client. Sensors and Arduino came from Adafruit. Moteino and RFM came from LowPowerLabs. Ethernet shield came from Amazon.</p>
