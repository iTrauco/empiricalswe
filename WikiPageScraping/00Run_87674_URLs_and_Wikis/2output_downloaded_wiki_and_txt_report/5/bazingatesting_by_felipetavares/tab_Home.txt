          <p>Welcome to the bazingatesting wiki!</p>
<p>The bazingatesting repository contains the testing code and tech for the Bazinga! Engine.
Currently it contains the new version of the engine, capable of executing lua scripts attached to objects.
This new version of the engine is also compatible (and only compatible) with the new IFGames map format, which is created by the Bazinga! Edit.</p>
<p>For a troubleless experience, its VERY recommended to put the Bazinga! Engine executable in the same folder of the Bazinga! Edit editor. This is because the paths used by the map format are relative to the base directory of the engine.</p>
