          <p>Please list all features you would like to see in upcoming releases of PHP Menu Grab and Convert. Where appropriate, I would like all features to be written down beforehand so we can have a discussion of what is needed and should be included in future releases. Then a spec draft for each feature can be created for developers to follow.</p>
