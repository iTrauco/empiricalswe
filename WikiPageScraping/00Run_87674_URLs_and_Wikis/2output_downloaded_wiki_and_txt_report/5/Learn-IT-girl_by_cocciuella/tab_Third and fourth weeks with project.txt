          <p>During this two weeks I was reading more chapters of PHP tutorial. I've read about:</p>
<ul>
<li>forms,</li>
<li>files,</li>
<li>multidimensional arrays,</li>
<li>error handling,</li>
<li>exceptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>When I've finished this, I started to read about MySQL. I've learned about: creating database and tables, inserting, selecting, updating and deleting data.</p>
<p>It was a huge amount of data to process, especially everything was new for me. And it still is. So, I will be reading even more, but now, when I have this basic knowledge, I can also start some serious coding ;)</p>
