<ul>
<li>Teams may consist of students from any degree program in any combination</li>
<li>HOWEVER, team members themselves must be capable of accomplishing all required deliverables, which include both substantial technical deliverables and substantial business deliverables</li>
<li>THEREFORE, our expectation is that most teams will require cross-program team members to accomplish all of the deliverables</li>
<li>"Balanced teams with one technical founder and one business founder raise 30% more money, have 2.9x more user growth and are 19% less likely to scale prematurely than technical or business-heavy founding teams." (Startup Genome Report)</li>
<li>Keep in mind that Startup Studio is first and foremost for educational purposes, not commercialization purposes. For those of you seriously considering leveraging your project as a startup venture after graduation, be open to teaming with students with no intention of entrepreneurship. Your "school teams" will not adversely affect your commercial venture, and you will learn much more and often be surprised how things work out</li>
<li>Teams can engage outside help (students in other schools, external practitioners, graphic designers, etc.), however that help cannot substitute for the team members themselves accomplishing all required deliverables—that would be cheating!</li>
<li>For students interested in continuing to develop their startup idea as a startup company after graduation, and are international students or are considering teaming with international students, note that international students can obtain F1 OPT work visas to continue working in the USA for 12 months after graduation—and STEM (MEng) students can extend their F1 OPT work visas an additional 24 months on top of the initial 12 months—during which period students can apply for another work visa (e.g., an H1B) to remain in the USA for longer periods. For more information, refer to the <a href="http://www.isso.cornell.edu/immigration/f1/opta.php" rel="nofollow">ISSO</a>, [watch this video] (<a href="https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/CTSR/International+Students" rel="nofollow">https://confluence.cornell.edu/display/CTSR/International+Students</a>), and talk to student services at Cornell Tech <em>before you graduate</em>
</li>

<ul>
<li>Teams can decide to pursue any startup idea they wish, with four constraints:</li>
<li>The idea must be digitally-enabled, i.e., it must be a "tech startup"</li>
<li>The team must be able to accomplish all required course deliverables in a semester timeframe (among other deliverables, the team must build an alpha product)—but this should not limit the vision of your startup idea!</li>
<li>Your idea cannot involve or result in activity that is a felony in New York</li>
<li>Your idea must be approved for Startup Studio by the Head of Startup Studio (see Teaming, below)</li>
<li>Teams can pivot their idea in the course of the semester, however they must still accomplish all required deliverables</li>
<li>Teams can pursue startup ideas that students have brought with them to Cornell Tech, or ideas based on pre-existing technologies, however those ideas cannot be operating companies or businesses: the purpose of Startup Studio is for all students on the team to have an end-to-end founding experience</li>
<li>If the idea stems from a company that a student has already incorporated, that company must be "non-operating": pre-product/market fit, no customers, no revenue—all students on the team must potentially have founding roles in the "new" company</li>
<li>Some students with business relationships may have an opportunity to start up an "internal venture" within an existing company. Depending on the nature of the internal venture, this may be an acceptable startup idea—talk to your instructor for approval</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Students must self-organize into teams (Dreamteam is not used, as in Product Studio)</li>
<li>Forming a team around a startup idea is hard, both intellectually and socially</li>
<li>There will be some people that have a hard time forming or joining a team</li>
<li>Everyone should have enough emotional intelligence to help everyone in the class team up—no founder left behind!</li>
<li>Your team and idea must be approved for Startup Studio by the Head of Startup Studio, by submitting the Startup Studio Team Application</li>
</ul>

<li>Part of the application requires your team to submit links to two videos. Please upload these videos to GoogleDrive, YouTube, Vimeo or similar platforms and add the links of your videos to the application. Make sure any viewing permission is set correctly</li>
<li>The Head of Startup Studio will push teams to improve their ideas and pursue opportunities "big enough" to be worthy pursuits for Startup Studio and let you know if you are approved or need to improve your idea further</li>
<li>If approved, you are good to go!</li>
<li>If not approved, you must try submitting again, paying attention to any comments you received over email or in Unicornucopia</li>
