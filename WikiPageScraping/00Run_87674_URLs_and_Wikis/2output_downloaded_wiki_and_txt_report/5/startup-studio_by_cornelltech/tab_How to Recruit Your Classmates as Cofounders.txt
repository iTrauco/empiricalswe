          <p>In the earliest days of building highly competitive startups the ability to identify and recruit co-founders is one of the most critical decisions you will make. The founding team sets the pace of execution, establishes the initial vision, attracts investment capital, and launches the earliest version of the product. However, finding the right people and convincing them to join you is not trivial. Talented people will often have multiple options, so you must present a compelling case to attract extraordinary people.</p>
<p>Below are tips that will help you recruit the right team for your startup:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Write a personal note to the person(s) that you are trying to recruit, and suggest a time to meet over coffee. Meet off campus to get to know your peers in a different setting.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember that this process is not always about you and your ideas, it’s about your team’s collective ideas and strengths. For this reason, start your conversations by listening to what your prospective teammates are looking to get out of Startup Studio and learn about the ideas that they are excited about pursuing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will be recruiting teammates that have different skills; however, do not think about them as people who can only perform one function (e.g. “you are an engineer and can build the algorithms”, “you are an MBA and can figure out the business model”, etc.). This is a leadership and collaborative experience, which requires your full participation in all aspects of building the company. Show your potential teammates that you are willingness to roll up your sleeves and work with them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Share your idea and make it clear that you are open to hearing their perspective, highlighting specifically why their perspective could evolve the idea into something great.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are three levels of dedication to be aware of when recruiting. Some people will be fully dedicated to building a company immediately following graduation. Others will warm up to the idea of being a full-time entrepreneur as the semester progresses. And there are people who know for certain they are not pursuing a startup following graduation. All of these dedication levels will work on your Startup Studio team, as long as your prospective teammate is open about them from the beginning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Take risks and pursue people you haven’t had a chance to meet. Create a reputation of opening your mind to different perspectives, and exercising your ability to make ideas bigger (e.g. using the market map, etc.). This will attract people to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If any of your friends are looking for co-founders and you know someone who might be a great fit, then talk to both parties and make the warm introduction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identify people you will enjoy working with and getting to know.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While you are putting these tips and tricks into practice, AVOID the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Recruiting an all MBA team with no technical ability to build software and technology.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recruiting engineers to "build the product". The entire co-founding team should contribute to the direction and vision of the company.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recruiting friends because you get along vs. people who have specific skills that make up for the team's gaps.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recruiting people to work on "your idea".</p>
</li>
</ul>
