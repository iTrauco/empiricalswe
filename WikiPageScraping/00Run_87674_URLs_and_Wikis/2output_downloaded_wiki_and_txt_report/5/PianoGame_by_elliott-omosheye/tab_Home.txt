          <p>Welcome to the PianoGame wiki!</p>
<p>Current system of game uses Guitar Hero/Rock band style of expecting you to play a note at an exact time. However with Piano music this is not a desired feature. First goal is to implement a system which allows for small deviations of input timing.</p>
<p>Current plan is to put song midi notes and user input into strings and compare them using a string edit distance metric.
Possible problems: Notes played at the same time may not be stored at the same time. Eg C#,A,B may be stored as A,B,C# this would give an error metric &gt; 0 which is incorrect. Whereas c# then A then B should always be played in that order. So there is a need to separate notes played together from sequential notes.</p>
<p>Instead of strings use vector with each index holding notes played together. Sort each index so C#,A,B is always stored the same way. Note: Ensure vector equality works as expected. New Issue: What does it mean to play notes at "the same time"? I assume (need to check) that the game runs at 60 fps so you have to play the notes within a 16ms time for it to be considered played at the same time. Possibly more appropriate to have a fixed timeframe not synced to game fps.</p>
