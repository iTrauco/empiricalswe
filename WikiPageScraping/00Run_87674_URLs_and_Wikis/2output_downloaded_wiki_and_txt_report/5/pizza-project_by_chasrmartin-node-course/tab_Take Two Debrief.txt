          <p>This is notes from debriefing the 18 Jan retry.</p>
<p>We used the <a class="internal present" href="/chasrmartin-node-course/pizza-project/wiki/Node-In-A-Day-%28Take-Two%29">Node in a Day (Take Two)</a> page.</p>
<p>Morgan started at about 11:30 (all times Eastern) with the prework.</p>
<p>We started at about 13:10</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Scope (Morgan)</p>
<ul>
<li>this seems good for a 6 hour workshop</li>
<li>our actual time was 2h40 but much of the initial setup had been done from the first iteration</li>
<li>Liked using the pre-written todo because it saves biolerplate</li>
<li>scotch.io tutorial isn't in sync with code</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Scope (charlie)</p>
<ul>
<li>I think maybe it needs more angular, this has concentrated on the back end</li>
<li>it seems possible it's a little short</li>
<li>for the formal course we should write our own example. scotch.io isn't in sync (see above) plus they're a little too cute sometimes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>we have <a class="internal present" href="/chasrmartin-node-course/pizza-project/wiki/Notes-taken">Notes taken</a> on immediate problems.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mongo prework was helpful</p>
<ul>
<li>use <a href="http://try.mongodb.org/" rel="nofollow">trymongo</a>
</li>
<li>mongo tutorials</li>
<li>Mongoose quickstart</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>More information on setting up the mongolab and on using mongo from command line</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ultimately the question is whether this is worth pursuing further.  I'll let Morgan make his own notes, but what we're looking for is getting up the first flat part of the learning curve. It appears that this can be done with a one-day course.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I (Charlie) think doing this with a group might be a valuable way to try it.  I'd like to try this with a chat group and 4-6 students working together.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I (Charlie) would like to provide some supplemental material that <em>isn't</em> part of the main path:</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>more Angular</li>
<li>more on REST</li>
<li>Relational vs NoSQL (Morgan's suggestion)</li>
<li>the advantages of a document-oriented DB</li>
<li>
<em>why</em> MEAN?</li>
<li>why Mongo vs Couch etc?</li>
<li>why Angular vs other JS front ends?</li>
</ul>

<p>Note: Nora, we think there's a one-day course for managers in these technology choice questions.</p>
