          <p>￼<strong>Our Idea</strong></p>
<p>Covers various Health issues at work</p>
<ul>
<li>Based on air quality may advise users to open doors or windows</li>
<li>Keep a check of coffee intake and after a certain amount, suggest other activities</li>
<li>Keep a check on user inactivity for long periods of time and suggest exercises to users
￼</li>
</ul>
<p>￼￼<strong>Interview</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A total of 16 users who work in offices were interviewed</li>
<li>Our interviewees were almost evenly spread over both genders with 9 out
of the 16 being male</li>
<li>Most of the users were in the age group of 20-30 with only 5 being above
30 years of age</li>
<li>Our questions covered the day to day activities of users in their offices</li>
<li>Questions ranged from the average number of hours they spend behind
their desk at work to the average number of coffee cups they consume in a
day</li>
<li>Most of our users had 35-40 hour weeks</li>
<li>Some users worked less than 30 hrs/week
￼</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>￼￼Coffee related questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Number of cups of coffee
** Most of the interviewees only drink 1 cup of coffee daily (60%) (We
don’t know how’d they live :P)
** Only 20% drink 2 - 3 cups of coffee
** and 20% drink more than 3</li>
<li>70% of the interviewees didn’t like to be checked how many cups of coffee they have daily</li>
</ul>
<p>￼￼<strong>Coffee related questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>85% like other activities instead of drinking coffee to avoid sleepiness</li>
<li>85% would like to do refreshing activities instead of having another cup of
coffee</li>
<li>Only 15% of people have a schedule on when they are going to drink their
coffee</li>
<li>85% didn’t like to be reminded on a certain time that they schedule to be
reminded to drink their coffee
￼</li>
</ul>
<p>￼￼<strong>Kinect related questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On an average users spend 5-7 hrs/day sitting behind their desk</li>
<li>75% of interviewed users said they generally do not perform any kind of
exercise while they are at work</li>
<li>Approximately 80% of the users said they would not mind their activities
around their office being monitored</li>
<li>Most users shared their office with other people but they said they would
mind performing some exercises if it helped them and did not take much
time</li>
<li>People were keen on the competition aspect of the system
￼</li>
</ul>
<p>￼<strong>Air quality related questions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Half of the interviewees are able to “measure” the air quality by feelings</li>
<li>Being informed about the bad air quality in the office, about 60%
interviewees would open the window despite the weather condition; 40%
would do so depending on the weather</li>
<li>70% would like the room temperature adjusted automatically based on
their preference</li>
<li>70% would like a suggestion to open the door instead of the window, when
it’s cold outside but the air is bad in the office
￼</li>
</ul>
