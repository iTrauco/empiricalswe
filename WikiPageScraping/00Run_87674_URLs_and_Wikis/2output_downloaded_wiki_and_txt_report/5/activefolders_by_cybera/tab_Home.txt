          <p>We propose to design, implement, and deploy a shared folder service for data, specifically for the research and HPC community. The challenges of a shared folder for this community include the large size of some of the files and the security requirements of data centres. Existing tools such as Dropbox are not well-­optimized to transport and synchronize tens of thousands of files, amounting to dozens of gigabytes or terabytes of data, across high-speed networks. In addition, tools like drop Dropbox itself have limited native encryption abilities. Finally, research and HPC centres would prefer familiar authentication mechanisms, such as grid certificates or standard public/private keys instead of proprietary solutions.</p>
