<p>Some instructions in this wiki only apply to specific versions of the hardware or software, and such cases will be noted. Currently two hardware (Control Box) version numbers are deployed, noted as (V1XX) which uses analog cameras and (V2XX) which uses digital cameras. Two major versions of the software exist noted as (EM1) based on debian xfce and (EM2) based on <a href="https://github.com/Ecotrust-Canada/em-karpix-env">karpix</a> (linux from scratch).</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the power draw of the EM system with the maximum number of digital cameras (4?), sensors, and control box?
The maximum draw I've measured with infrared (night vision) disabled is  2.5A at 12V. Cameras use about 300 mA, and the box uses under 1A. Other sensors are pretty negligible (tens of milliamps). I havn't tested with infrared turned on, but it could be significantly higher.</li>
<li>Do the cameras used by EC have an IP rating that indicates the camera's resistance to water? Or have they been modified to make them more water resistant or waterproof in any way?
They are IP67 rated</li>
<li>What is the recommended temperature range for the EM equipment (control box, cameras, sensors, etc.)? Are there different ranges for each category of gear?
PSI Sensors : -20 C to 85 C
RFID scanner: -30 C to 50 C
Cameras : -20 C to 50 C
Control Box: 4 C to 40 C preferred to avoid condensation.</li>
<li>Are there some EC control boxes which are able to accommodate digital cameras only while others can accommodate both digital and analog cameras? The EM boxes are able to run different types of cameras based on the software version that they run on.
Some boxes do not have CCTV plugs (V2XX series). The original V1XX series has both.</li>
</ul>

<p>The technician portion of these Wiki pages are designed to provide support to the Ecotrust Technician during EM Box Installation and service. Sensor troubleshooting and the linux commands needed to maintain a system which collects data effectivly are covered in this wiki. You will also find wiring diagrams related to the system and sensors included within this guide.</p>
<p>The EM system consists of a control box and several peripherals. This document will list a set of tools recommended for use in an EM installation kit. It describes the connectivity required for a functioning EM system, and suggests a workflow for troubleshooting issues encountered during installation.</p>
<p>We hope that any problems that arise can be addressed with the help of this manual. In the case of an event not covered or clearly in this manual, please contact your port supervisor, lead technician or development team.</p>
<p>Thank you for helping Ecotrust provide service that exceeds standards in the electronic monitoring industry.</p>
<p>Good Luck. Have fun!</p>
