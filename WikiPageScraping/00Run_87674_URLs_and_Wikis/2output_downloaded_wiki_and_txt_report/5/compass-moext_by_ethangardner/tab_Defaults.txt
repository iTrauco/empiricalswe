<p>Note that the class names from the <code>$grid</code> and <code>$layout</code> maps are automatically prefixed with the <code>$app-ns</code> variable if it has been defined. In other words, if the <code>$app-ns</code> has a value of <code>"moext"</code> then the output of the grid classes would become <code>.moext-grid-1</code> through <code>.moext-grid-12</code> as it is depicted in the defaults provided by the library.</p>
