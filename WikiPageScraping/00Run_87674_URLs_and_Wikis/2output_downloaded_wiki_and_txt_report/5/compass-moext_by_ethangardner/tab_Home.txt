<p>Momentum Extension (aka Moext) is a Compass extension meant to provide a structure
for responsibly scoped modules and widgets. The premise of this
comes from my work as a Front-End Developer, where I have been using
<a href="http://github.com/ethangardner/momentum-css">Momentum CSS</a> in various
iterations since 2008.</p>
<p>In this work, I have observed many HTML5 creatives (i.e. web ads)
that are not served through an iframe and eventually collide with the
styles that are declared on the host site. From this, I identified a need
for a convetion to prevent these creatives from interfering with the host
site CSS and vice-versa. In part, this is also due to CSS lacking namespace
support like many web scripting languages.</p>
<p>Moext provides a basic starter CSS file, a fluid grid, and utility classes
that can be defined by the user. Perhaps more importantly, it also provides
a convention for authoring modules that are isolated from the common scope
of an application.</p>
