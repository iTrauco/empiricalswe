          <p>$EE <strong>RELEXPR</strong> - the first byte is the number of bytes to generate, and is &lt;= <code>NUMLEN</code>. This is followed by a <code>NUMLEN</code> byte displacement from the current location counter, which is the origin for a relative branch. An expression of the same format as that for <a class="internal present" href="/ksherlock/java-libomf/wiki/EXPR">EXPR</a> follows this value. The expression is resolved as a <code>NUMLEN</code> byte absolute address, then a relative branch is generated from the origin to the computed destination. The result is truncated to the needed number of bytes, and checked to insure that no range errors resulted from the truncation.</p>
