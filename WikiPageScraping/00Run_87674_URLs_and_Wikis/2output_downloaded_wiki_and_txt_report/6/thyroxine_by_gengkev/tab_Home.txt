          <p>Welcome to the thyroxine wiki! thyroxine was created in the fall of 2014 as its first author's sort of mindless pursuit towards doing something interesting with Android. Its development was spurred by the discovery of Iodine's unofficial APIs for Eighth and News. Currently, thyroxine implements basic News and Eighth functionality. This is supported by an SQL databases that is updated using a SyncAdapter for offline use. Android's native account service is used to hold Iodine authentication credentials.</p>
<p>Other projects of interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://code.google.com/p/android-tjintranet/" rel="nofollow">android-tjintranet</a>, which was built in early 2010, although development seems to have halted since then. The application was apparently able to sign into Intranet and load the news feed by parsing its HTML. However, I could not verify this myself as sign-in didn't work, and I was too lazy to figure out why.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/el1t/Iolite">Iolite</a>, an Iodine client born in late 2014. After signing in, it provides eighth period and schedule functionality via Iodine's unofficial API. It is currently available <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.el1t.iolite" rel="nofollow">on the Play Store</a>, and is likely the only one with users. Encouraged!</li>
