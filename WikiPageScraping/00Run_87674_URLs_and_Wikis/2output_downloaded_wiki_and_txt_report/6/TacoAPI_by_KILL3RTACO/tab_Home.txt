          <p>#Features
Some notable features of TacoAPI include (but are not limited to):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="wiki/Command-Handling">Command Handling</a></li>
<li>
<a href="https://github.com/KILL3RTACO/TacoAPI/wiki/InventoryMenus">Custom Inventory Menus</a> (like that of the CreateYourOwnMenus plugin) [Bukkit only]</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/KILL3RTACO/TacoAPI/wiki/Databasing-with-MySQL">Abstracted MySQL Database interface</a></li>
<li>Pagination</li>
<li>PageViewers (uses Pagination)</li>
<li>Built-in TacoSerialization [Bukkit only]</li>
<li>Built-in <a href="wiki/TBukkit">TBukkit</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a lot of features/packages can be used outside of Bukkit. In fact, any package or class not within <code>com.kill3rtaco.api.bukkit</code> (with a few exceptions) can be used outside of plugins. There are also packages and classes within <code>com.kill3rtaco.api.bukkit</code> that extend the functionality of the core API to fit in with the Bukkit interface.</p>
<p>If you want to use bits and pieces of TacoAPI in your own project, Bukkit or otherwise, that's fine, but I have a few rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unless you know for sure there won't be a namespace issue (for instance, if it's not a Bukkit plugin), then make sure the packages are renamed so there won't be any conflict.</li>
<li>Make sure you now the dependencies of some of the classes. For instance, TacoSerialization uses the <code>org.json</code> package for JSON, not <code>json-simple</code>.</li>
<li>Credit me somehow <img align="absmiddle" alt=":heart:" class="emoji" data-canonical-src="https://assets-cdn.github.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2764.png" height="20" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a71ac48290b2d5856b481ef9f4643099aacf756f/68747470733a2f2f6173736574732d63646e2e6769746875622e636f6d2f696d616765732f69636f6e732f656d6f6a692f756e69636f64652f323736342e706e67" title=":heart:" width="20"/> Even if it's as simple as "This plugin/project uses part of TacoAPI by KILL3RTACO", or something similar.</li>
<li>And finally, use it responsibly. This collection of utilities was not designed to aid in the creation of malicious software.</li>
</ul>
