          <p>A bash script is a simple file that contains ASCII text intended to be interpreted by the program <strong>bash</strong>, allowing you to run a logical sequence of commands by calling a simple line command instead of typing them one at a time in the shell.</p>
<p>The first line of a script should always tell the shell which program should interpret it:</p>
<pre><code>#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello World, I am a 42 student!"
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the script should be interpreted by <strong>/bin/bash</strong> and say Hello when it is invoked.
To invoke the script, you can type <code>sh scriptname</code> or - in a better way - make it executable with a <code>chmod</code>:</p>
<pre><code>[shell prompt]$ chmod 755 scriptname
[shell prompt]$ ./scriptname
</code></pre>
<p>Add your commands one at a line in the script file and call external programs as you do in the shell.
Bash has a lot of builtin functions and enables you to write some real applications with variables, conditions, loops, functions...</p>
<p>Info: <strong>42FileChecker does not support</strong> the recommended way to execute a bash script by making it executable with a <code>chmod</code> because any change made on a file of the project will automatically display a warning message at launch to tell the user that the local version differs with the remote one.</p>
