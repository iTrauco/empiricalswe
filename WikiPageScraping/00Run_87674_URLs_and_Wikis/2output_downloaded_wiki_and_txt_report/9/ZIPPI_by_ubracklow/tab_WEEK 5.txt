<p><em>Most of last week I was wrestling with my new frenemy Django. I found a very beginner friendly tutorial by the <a href="http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/index.html" rel="nofollow">DjangoGirls</a>. It is really well explained and reduced to the basics (much less detailed than the one on the official <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/" rel="nofollow">Django homepage</a> which I found too extensive aka confusing to follow). But still it took me forever to set everything up. I had never even worked with the command prompt before.... Until this monday when I had my personal breakthrough - deploying my work to heroku finally worked.</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Happy monday - Django revelation! After many (MANY!) trials I was finally able to deploy the DjangoGirls tutorial project and get on with the rest of the tasks.</li>
<li>I went to the Python Co-Learning Meet-up group here in Berlin. Great to see that I am not alone with my endeavor to learn Python. Also another prove for me how supportive the tech community is. I met there with Tamara. She answered my github help request that I had posted in the Berlin Geekette Facebook group in week one of LearnItGirl. We skyped and found out that she is also a mentor on this project. What a lucky coincidence and extra support! :)</li>
<li>I have completed the remaining sections of the DjangoGirls tutorial.</li>
<li>I started to set up a project for zippi and am now working on the models.</li>
</ul>
