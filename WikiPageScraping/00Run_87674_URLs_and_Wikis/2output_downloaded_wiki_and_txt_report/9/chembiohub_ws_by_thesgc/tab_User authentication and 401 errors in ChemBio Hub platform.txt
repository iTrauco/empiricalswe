          <p>By default, login is handled by the django login system.</p>
<p>We also include and example custom deployment of ChemBio Hub where the login credentials are checked in python <a href="../blob/master/example_custom_deployment/backends.py">against a different internal database</a>.</p>
<p>As the system is built with Django, theoretically any of the <a href="https://www.djangopackages.com/grids/g/authentication/" rel="nofollow">login mechanisms supported by django</a> could be integrated. Please raise a ticket if you have interest in this.
We have integrated the login parts of our application with University of Oxford's <a href="https://github.com/ox-it/django-webauth">WebAuth system</a> but this is not included in the default install listed here.</p>
<p>Cross site scripting is prevented by use of the django CSRF cookie. The setting of this cookie is forced when the user logs on by use of the <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/blob/master/cbh_core_api/resources.py#L883">get token function</a>. This cookie is then ensured to be added to every request made by the front end as a HTTP header. This forcing is done using a <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/ng-chem/blob/master/app/scripts/app.js#L537">$http interceptor</a> and also separately for the <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/ng-chem/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=X-CSRFToken">$http requests made by the angular flowjs app</a>. Not adding this to the request will result in a 401 error which is quite hard to trace back.</p>
<p>The default deployment of ChemBio Hub uses Apache server directives to ensure that the angular index.html file is served under python by uwsgi. This acts as an additional security measure and allows most requests to be redirected to the login page if the user is not authenticated.</p>
