          <p>##Front End</p>
<p>The ChemBio Hub platform's user interface is javascript based and built using AngularJS. It uses Grunt for building and deployment, Bower for dependency management.</p>
<p>###Architecture</p>
<p>The ChemBio Hub platform uses <a href="https://github.com/angular-ui/ui-router/wiki">angular-ui</a> to present the user with a series of single page apps - divided by url-based state - to perform various functions and also provide search pages. These states are defined within the app.js file, along with the appropriate controllers for each state. The user interface also provides a simpler admin experience than using Django's admin pages.</p>
<p>Items are registered within <em>batches</em>. This means that versions of the same item can be registered to allow multiple users to register with different metadata (for example supplier info, purity, or other "real world" information). This has particular use with chemical compound registration but can also be applicable to general inventory items.</p>
<p>Searching of items is powered by Elasticsearch which has enabled the app to have better-performing filters, sorting and text search.</p>
<p>Information is obtained from the Django back end via web service calls. Details on these can be found within the individual respoitories. More details at <a class="internal absent" href="/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/wiki/Project-structure">Project structure</a>.</p>
<p>###Extending This App</p>
<p>If you feel the need for extra controllers, views, services or directives, you can use Yeoman to generate extra files for this project. Yeoman will set up a default file when you specify the type of file to generate (e.g. yo angular:controller ControllerName). Install Yeoman within this project and follow the guides. More info about Yeoman can be found <a href="http://yeoman.io/" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
