          <p>A script has been created to export a project and its list of files into a folder. It is run as follows:</p>
<p>Activate the conda environment for your project (default name is chembiohub, name we use at Oxford is hub)</p>
<pre><code>export ENV_NAME=chembiohub
source activate ${ENV_NAME}
</code></pre>
<p>Run the backup script:</p>
<pre><code>python manage.py delete_and_backup [Folder name to back up to]
</code></pre>
<p>OR if you only want to back up and not delete run:</p>
<pre><code>python manage.py backup_project [Folder name to back up to]
</code></pre>
<p>To back up all projects, run:</p>
<pre><code>python manage.py backup_all_projects [Folder name to back up to]
</code></pre>
<p>You will then be asked by the script which project or projects you want to backup and delete. The script will delete all parts of the project - elasticsearch indices, attachments and all database records including the project config and the compound batches.</p>
<p>The structure of the backed up folder looks like the below. The restore procedure is documented on <a class="internal present" href="/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/wiki/Restoring-a-single-project">Restoring a single project</a></p>
