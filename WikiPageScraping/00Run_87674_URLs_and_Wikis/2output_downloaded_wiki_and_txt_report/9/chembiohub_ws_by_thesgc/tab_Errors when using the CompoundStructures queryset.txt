          <p>The queryset from:</p>
<p>CompoundStructures.objects.all()</p>
<p>Or any other queryset containing compound structures cannot be visualised or outputted. you must instead use values lists or other functions as I have done in this file <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/blob/master/cbh_chem_api/tasks.py">https://github.com/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/blob/master/cbh_chem_api/tasks.py</a></p>
<p>The reason for these errors is that django has been "tricked" into treating the compound structures table as binary blobs when in fact it is an RDKit molecule.</p>
<p>This can be avoided by using the new django rdkit module <a href="https://github.com/rdkit/django-rdkit">https://github.com/rdkit/django-rdkit</a> but we have not had time to implement this</p>
