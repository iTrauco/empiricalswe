          <p>Data is imported into to ChemBio Hub in a multi step process (unfinished refactoring)</p>

<ul>
<li>File uploads to import data. TODO - add screenshots here.
<ol>
<li>The ng-flow directive is declared in the <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/ng-chem/blob/master/app/views/add-compounds2.html#L7">addcompounds page</a>
</li>
<li>The back end URL is set up via the <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/blob/master/cbh_chem_api/urls.py#L72">flowjs third party app</a>
</li>
<li>On upload of the data the <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/django-flowjs/blob/master/flowjs/views.py#L62">session id and file id is passed back to the front end</a>
</li>
<li>The success function declared in the ng-flow directive (<a href="https://github.com/thesgc/ng-chem/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=%22%24scope.assignFile%22">assignFile</a>) is called in order to process the data</li>
<li>The new data is processed <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/blob/master/cbh_chem_api/compounds.py#L951">via the old compound adding API</a> using python pandas to read the Excel files and a combination of regex, RDKit and pybel (openbabel) to read SDF files</li>
<li>Statistics as to the number of compounds <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/blob/master/cbh_chem_api/compounds.py#L652">uploaded etc are collated</a>
</li>
<li>The first page of the data is searched <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/blob/master/cbh_chem_api/compounds.py#L802">via the old search API</a>
</li>
<li>The returned columns list is used to <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/ng-chem/blob/master/app/scripts/directives/handsoncompoundtable.js#L43">build a user interface for the updating of field mappings</a>
</li>
<li>The user can update the mappings for custom fields and <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/ng-chem/blob/7589e824d3e0685f1cd4b4f72e76d98ac3acde2d/app/scripts/controllers/addcompounds.js#L155">setMappedFieldInController</a> is called which then calls the <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/blob/master/cbh_chem_api/compounds.py#L624">backend service to update custom fields</a>
</li>
<li>Once the user is satisfied that the custom fields have been updated they press save which calls <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/ng-chem/blob/7589e824d3e0685f1cd4b4f72e76d98ac3acde2d/app/scripts/controllers/addcompounds.js#L74">saveTemporaryCompoundData function</a>
</li>
<li>this then makes a webservice call to <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/blob/master/cbh_chem_api/compounds.py#L488">multi batch save</a> Data is then saved and a multiple batch ID is returned to the front end</li>
<li>The front end <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/ng-chem/blob/7589e824d3e0685f1cd4b4f72e76d98ac3acde2d/app/scripts/controllers/addcompounds.js#L80">redirects to the search page</a> via a state transition in ui-router in order to view a confirmation of the items in the new multiple batch.</li>
</ol>

</ul>
