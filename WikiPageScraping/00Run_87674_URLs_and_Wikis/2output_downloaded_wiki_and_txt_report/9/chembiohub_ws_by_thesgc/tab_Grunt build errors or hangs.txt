          <p>Sometimes grunt build can break two possible consequences:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The CSS becomes unreadable - this can happen if there is an error in your css file or a neew feature which is not yet supported by cssmin. For example, we broke it with:</p>
<p>a.disabled
{
color: grey;
a:hover, a:focus {
color: grey;
}
}</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sometimes the Running "htmlmin:dist" (htmlmin) task in grunt build breaks or the .
Grunt build just hangs having printed out the name of the file it is currently working on or maybe the previous file.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This happens if there is for example an unclosed attribute in the angular html or perhaps an invalid character in a piece of html.</p>
