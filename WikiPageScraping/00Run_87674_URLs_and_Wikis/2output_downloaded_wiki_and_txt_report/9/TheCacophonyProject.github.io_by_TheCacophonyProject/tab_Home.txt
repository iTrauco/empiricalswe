<p>Comments on recorders from Laura Molles</p>
<p>Recorders
I've had experience with two different automated recorders, and am likely to try out a third in the next few months. My ideal autonomous recorder would have the following characteristics:</p>
<p>-Capable of 4-24kHz sampling rate (higher rates would be a bonus, but not necessary)
-Flexible programming for the recording schedule, so I could run one or two long recording periods per day, or many shorter recording periods, etc.
-Minimum SDHC storage capacity of 32GB (the more the better, especially if there is a solar power option)
-Minimum 80 hours recording time per battery charge
-Solar-power option
-Stereo recording capability, with ability to set separate gain levels for each mic (one can be set to maximise range, one can be set lower to capture audio from nearby birds without clipping)
-GPS capability - not necessarily for determining location, but so that the clocks on multiple recorders can be satellite-synched; this means that at least in theory multiple recorders can be deployed as an array. Alternatively, there may be a cheaper way of synching multiple recorders before deployment, or with an external device?
-Very robust to rain etc. of course, and with a casing that can be locked closed and to a tree so we can feel a bit safer placing it in sites where they might be noticed by the public
-Cost somewhere in the neighbourhood of NZ$500 per unit. The cheaper the better, of course....</p>
<p>Here are the recorders I know of and how they stack up against that list:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Cornell Lab of Ornithology SoundCache/Wildlife Acoustics Song Meter (<a href="http://wildlifeacoustics.com/products/song-meter-sm3-land" rel="nofollow">http://wildlifeacoustics.com/products/song-meter-sm3-land</a>). I have a few of the Cornell recorders, which are equivalent to Wildlife Acoustics' SM2 model. The newer, current version of these recorders, with the optional GPS add-on, tick almost all of the boxes for an ideal recorder: high sampling rates, awesome capacity (up to 4 x 256GB SDHC cards), great battery life, stereo recording, flexible programming, robust, and the option to plug in external power sources including solar. Their main fault, unsurprisingly, is price: with GPS, they're US$1150 - and that's if I buy them in the US and carry them back to NZ with me. International shipping and customs puts them completely out of reach. I only have my three SM2's because Cornell was kind enough to arrange a no-cost indefinite "lease" when they discovered they weren't allowed to actually sell them to me.</p>

<li>
<p>Department of Conservation-built automated recorders. No website for these, but they can be purchased from DoC at a cost of about NZ$400. I don't own any of these, but have used them for kiwi monitoring and vocalisation work. These are adequate for the job, and seem to be quite robust, but have a number of limitations. They max out at a 16kHz sampling rate, and have a maximum storage capacity of 16GB (1 x 16GB SDHC card). They are mono recorders and can only be programmed to run 1-2 recording sessions per day. There is no GPS capability, or option for external/solar power. On the plus side, battery life seems to be a respectable 90-120 hours on 4 good-quality AA's, and they seem to be pretty robust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>WildSupply, an Australian company, are currently offering a beta version of a recorder that I may try out:(<a href="http://wildsupply.com.au/media/pdf/biologicalAcousticRecorder.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://wildsupply.com.au/media/pdf/biologicalAcousticRecorder.pdf</a>). Their beta price is AU$670 - I'm not sure what the standard price will be for the final product. These units will have built-in GPS, good sampling rates, and flexible scheduling - they also look like they will be quite robust. On the downside, they are mono recorders, and the 80 hours recording time per charge is close to the minimum that will be useful for some projects.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>When I'm looking at recorders, I tend to think in terms of maximum usefulness for behavioural studies, which will typically require higher-quality recordings than are necessary for monitoring and species identification work - so my "wish list" is overkill for most conservation-oriented applications. If I step back and think of what features would be most useful for conservation/monitoring applications, I think the key things are battery life (or solar capability), storage capacity, robustness and cost. The less often recorders need to be serviced, the better. For example, with the kiwi work, poor weather can mean that sites can't be accessed for weeks at a time, and every day they're sitting with a full SD card and/or dead batteries we miss out on data.</p>
<p>Gear aside, of course, the limiting step in using automated recorders is handling the masses of data that result. I know there are a number of different research groups overseas working on automated detection and classification programs. As I think I mentioned when we talked in Akaroa, I think that in New Zealand we need to start by building a good sound library that can be used to "train" such a system. The UK and the US have a real head start in that regard. I've also not been tempted to delve into that area yet because for the most part I've been focused on one species at a time, meaning that I can scan recordings fairly quickly. With the kiwi recordings, for example, I use Raven Pro (<a href="http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/raven/ravenoverview.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.birds.cornell.edu/brp/raven/ravenoverview.html</a>) to batch-bandpass filter everything before even opening it, and then can glance over a night's worth of recordings in about 15 minutes. It's possible with kiwi because there's not much noise at night, and their calls are long and conspicuous even in the waveform. Processing daytime recordings, on the other hand, can be very time consuming, and generally requires skimming through spectrograms (slower) or just listening through headphones while I'm doing other things (slower still). It's still manageable if I'm focused on one species and a small number of recorders. I'm pretty sure I could use Raven's detector function to some degree - at least to limit my scanning to sections of recording with above-ambient sound levels - but I just haven't tried it yet to be honest.</p>
<p>I think the dream for automated acoustic monitoring is really a long-life, high-capacity recorder that detects and classifies calls from a wide range of species, records/stores only those sounds of interest, and sends the data straight to the computer of the person who deployed it. I'd buy as many of those as I could afford, and I'd put them everywhere. If they had time-synch capability and good sampling rates to boot, I'd be trying to use them to track movements and interactions of individual birds.</p>
<p>RFID
I'm interested in putting RFID leg bands on a few different species - tui, bellbirds and possibly silvereyes - to monitor feeder use. With tui, I would like to use RFID data to work out the extent to which tui use feeders throughout the year and whether some individuals may be dependent on them to any extent. The bellbird work would be more "basic science" oriented; a student and I would like to run some feeder experiments to see if bellbirds can remember temporal patterns in food availability. With the silvereyes, I'm interested in looking at rates/patterns of feeder use and possibly monitoring survival (e.g. using RFID detectors on feeders as a "mark-recapture" technique).</p>
<p>A student in Auckland recently used this sort of systems to monitor feeder use by introduced species, but she used a different sort of system to the one I'm looking at. She used gear from an Australian company (<a href="http://microchips.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://microchips.com.au/</a> ), including a pass-through antenna, and injected tags into the birds' backs. I'm looking to use a much cheaper system, and one that uses leg-band mounted tags plus a perch-mounted antenna. The system I'm looking to build has been developed by a US researcher, Eli Bridge, and he's described it in some depth on the research group's website (<a href="http://animalmigration.org/RFID/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://animalmigration.org/RFID/index.htm</a>). I've also attached a paper by their research group that describes the devices. I purchased 25 of the boards needed to build the readers, plus a bunch of tags, on my last trip to the US but haven't yet built a full reader (they need antennae, battery packs and housings) or made tags. I suspect it's very straightforward stuff for someone with any basic electronics experience - and although I'm confident I could figure it out, I haven't had time to play around with it yet. Plus, the boards I have are a newer version than that described on the website - they have an SD card slot, for example. Eli Bridge was very helpful with my initial questions about the system, so I'm sure he'd be able to provide some extra guidance, but I haven't chased him up on it. I think you mentioned your son might be looking for a relatively straightforward project to help with - if he's still looking for something, he'd certainly be welcome to work on this. I already have most of the materials, plus funding for the extra bits and pieces that will be needed to build full readers. If he's interested in having some more creative input, it would be great to have help developing and testing feeder and perch setups that work well with the readers.</p>
<p>Tracking
Not sure how familiar you are with animal tracking in general - if you're interested, I've attached a quick description of currently-used bird tracking technologies (also by Eli Bridge et al). I have two projects on at the moment that involve tracking (the tui project and great spotted kiwi monitoring work), and other projects that would benefit from tracking work. We'd love to be able to just have GPS tags on everything so we could sit back and watch the data arrive from the satellites. Alas, little birds can't haul around batteries that make that possible for any length of time. There are some GPS tags suitable for small birds that will collect and store a week or two's worth of data, but the catch is you need to retrieve the tag to retrieve the data - not a realistic proposition for most of New Zealand's terrestrial birds. GPS tags have been used successfully for some larger birds (e.g. kereru - I've attached a paper on this). Eventually, GPS tags will be small enough and cheap enough to be used for the kind of studies I'd like to do, but we're not there yet.</p>
<p>Great spotted kiwi are certainly big enough to carry around a GPS tag, but since they're on (or under) the ground and beneath thick canopy, GPS reception is very poor. Plus, the VHF tags carried by most of the kiwi I'm monitoring store activity data (how many minutes/day a bird was moving around for each of 14 days) and transmit this as a series of beeps that can be recorded in the field. This data allows us to work out which birds are attempting to breed and when.</p>
<p>Collecting transmitter data, particularly using triangulation to estimate location, is time-consuming and frustrating. With kiwi, we're normally "tracking" them while they're asleep, and the main challenge is access to sites (limited by river flows) and accuracy (getting accurate bearings for triangulation in steep terrain is very difficult). With species like tui and kereru, getting accurate location data to study habitat use is nearly impossible because the birds are always on the move. There are a few potential solutions out there already, but I haven't had the resources to try them yet.</p>
<p>One is Wildtech's Sky Ranger (see page 13 in <a href="http://www.kiwisforkiwi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2010_National_Kiwi_Hui_Proceedings.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.kiwisforkiwi.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/2010_National_Kiwi_Hui_Proceedings.pdf</a>), which overcomes terrain and access issues by automating the process and using an airplane. Sounds fabulous, but most projects won't have that kind of budget.</p>
<p>A second method that's been used for some time is the deployment of stationary receivers ("snarks" - <a href="http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/the-snark/" rel="nofollow">http://kakaporecovery.org.nz/the-snark/</a>). I've been looking into a longer-range version of this for the bellbird foraging work I'm getting underway, and also for tui work (<a href="http://encounternet.net/" rel="nofollow">http://encounternet.net/</a>). Encounternet can in theory be used to triangulate individual's locations, but deploying a high enough density of receivers for this to be really useful is still very costly.  One of the things about this system that really interests me is the ability to have tags store information on tag-tag proximity wherever the birds go, and then transmit it to a base station for retrieval. Lots of  possibilities for looking at habitat use, feeder use, and social interactions, all of which have potential monitoring/management/conservation applications.</p>
<p>With the kiwi work (and some other projects I know of), I can see the potential benefits of a system sort of in between the Sky Ranger and Encounternet systems: a ground-based detector with range similar to that of a hand-held receiver that could collect data on a programmed schedule and store the results. Something fancier could probably work out the approximate signal direction, and an array of these might even be able to provide a rough estimation of location. Detectors capable of running for lengthy periods and operating to a set schedule (e.g. record kiwi activity patterns once every two weeks, scan for morepork signals once an hour) would facilitate long-term monitoring in hard-to-access areas.</p>
<p>A similar "dream" system for monitoring kiwi habitat use and interactions would allow deployment of an array of detectors on each of several kiwi territories that would shunt all of the data down to one easily-accessible node. Getting myself and a bunch of batteries up to 1200m twice a year to deploy and retrieve detectors is feasible; getting myself up and down twice a month to retrieve data is not!</p>
<p>One last note on tracking tech: an ongoing issue with attachment of all harness-attached tracking devices is the design of "weak links," which in theory 1) allows a transmitter harness to break if it gets caught up on something, freeing the bird and 2) degrades over time so that a bird doesn't carry around a dead transmitter for years on end. Weak links generally comprise building a short length of cotton thread (protected by very fine plastic tubing) into the harness. (Most of the harness is built from thicker material, like the core from a shoelace or elastic.) Documentation of weak link failures have led to restrictions on transmitter use for some species, including kereru. I've often wondered if there wasn't some way to build at least an end-of-battery-life weak link into a transmitter.....</p>
<p>And finally, Camera Traps
I'm new to use of camera traps, but in the short time I've been using them with the tui project, I've really gotten excited about their potential. The main limitation of the cameras I'm using at the moment is that they were built primarily for hunters, so work best with longer focal distances. I've found one version that has had a bit of a tack-on fix to make it more suitable for feeder monitoring, but I haven't tried it yet (<a href="http://www.bushnell.com/wildlife/trail-cameras/natureview/natureview-cam-hd-max-color-lcd" rel="nofollow">http://www.bushnell.com/wildlife/trail-cameras/natureview/natureview-cam-hd-max-color-lcd</a>). I'm cautiously hopeful that by using a short focal length, I'll be able to reduce the number of useless photos that result from the camera being triggered by moving leaves, etc. in the background.</p>
<p>As with automated recorders, camera traps create a huge amount of data that needs to be sifted through; I haven't given much thought as to how that processing can be improved. Kinopta (<a href="http://kinopta.com/?page_id=21" rel="nofollow">http://kinopta.com/?page_id=21</a>) has developed software that facilitates scanning large numbers of photos quickly (and also uses time-lapse rather than motion detection to reduce the missing of fast-moving subjects). I've recently borrowed a black &amp; white version of this camera to try out; they do build a colour version, which would be necessary for reading leg bands, but the price tag (NZ$1200 + GST) means it won't be something I can deploy widely.</p>
<p>If I did have some way of limiting photos to, say, tui (either through image recognition or in combination with detection of an RFID tag - or possibly just weight on the perch), it would be fun to have photos automatically uploaded to the web. Some fancier camera traps do have GSM capability.</p>
