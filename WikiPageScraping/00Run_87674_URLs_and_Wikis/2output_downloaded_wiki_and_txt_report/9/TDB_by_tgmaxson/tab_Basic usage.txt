          <p>TDB is designed to be used from a command line or from a script.  To ease this,  the default functions store a database at ~/.tmpdb.db which is considered to be the working database.  This database is stored as an intermediate so that the path of the current database does not have to be repeatedly inputted / stored long term.</p>
<hr/>
<p>The following commands manipulate the database itself.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>tdb-load filename</code> will load the database at <code>filename</code> into the working database.  This will overwrite the working database,  so save before calling this function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tdb-save filename</code> will save the working database at <code>filename</code>.  This does not remove the working database from being active.  If you wish to work on another database either load a new one or clear it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tdb-clear filename</code> will clear the working database by deleting it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p>The following commands are designed to work with data in the database.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>tdb-add directory</code> will add <code>directory</code> to the database if possible.  The actual script called will determine if the directory can actually be added or not.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tdb-add-dir directory [filter]</code> will recursively add <code>directory</code> to the database if possible.  All directories will be added to the database within <code>directory</code> in an attempt to find valid calculations.  This works the same as piping a <code>find</code> command into <code>tmb-add</code>, more or less.  If the <code>filter</code> parameter is included, any directories containing <code>filter</code> in their path will be skipped.  This can be used to skip old/extended calculations if they are named in a way that allows them to be determined based on pathname.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tdb-excel</code> will use XLSXWriter to write a basic <code>Output.xlsx</code> file to the current directory.  This file will be lack any real formatting and is mainly useful for extracting the data to another program / running through a script to format it.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p>The following commands are used to change the script used to import calculations.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>tdb-source-script scriptname</code> is used to set the import script to one of the builtin scripts bundled with tdb.  By default the script <code>vasp-basic</code> is used.  The scriptname should not include the leading <code>tdb-</code>,  but they are stored in the <code>tools</code> directory as such.  To work this command MUST be run with <code>source</code> or with a leading <code>.</code> before <code>tdb-source-script</code>.  This is required because it sets the environment variable TDB_IMPORT</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tdb-source-userscript scriptname</code> is the same as <code>tdb-source-script</code> except that it requires an absolute path to the script.  This can be used for custom scripts and/or bundled scripts,  although the other function is significantly easier to use for the bundled scripts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<hr/>
<p>The following scripts are bundled with TDB.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><code>tdb-vasp-basic directory name.db</code> is used for basic VASP calculations and is the script that <code>tdb-excel</code> currently supports properly.  It can be called manually with the name of the database following it,  but typically this script should be loaded into tdb with <code>tdb-source-script</code> like other bundled scripts. This is the default script loaded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>tdb-vasp-slabfilm directory name.db</code> is used for VASP calculations set up in a Slab+Film configuration.  This is tailored to work with a specific type of system and is basically an extension of <code>tdb-vasp-basic</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
