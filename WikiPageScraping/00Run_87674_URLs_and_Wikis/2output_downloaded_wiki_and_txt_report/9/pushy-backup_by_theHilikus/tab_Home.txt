          <p>This is a snapshot backup solution that allows for easy restoration of files.</p>
<p>It is similar to <a href="http://rsnapshot.org/" rel="nofollow">rsnapshot</a> (which itself is based on <a href="http://www.mikerubel.org/computers/rsync_snapshots/" rel="nofollow">this article</a>) except that it pushes data instead of pulling it. There is a hack available in the rsnapshot FAQ to allow push backups but I decided to create a new solution and cover security (transfer is done via SSH), which is not covered in the FAQ</p>
