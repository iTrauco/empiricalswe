          <p>All code not explicitly marked with another license is made available under the terms of the Oculus SDK license, included in this kit as LICENSE.TXT and available online at <a href="https://developer.oculusvr.com/license" rel="nofollow">https://developer.oculusvr.com/license</a> and is Copyright 2013 Oculus VR, Inc.</p>
<p>Please be aware that code you submit that is <em>derived</em> from the SDK code may become property of OculusVR and that you will retain no exclusive rights to it.  This does not apply to application code that uses the SDK code, or to the code in the Samples directory, which is mostly licensed under Apache 2.0.  If you create a new sample application you retain your rights.  However if you port the sensor fusion code to another language, this will likely be considered a derived work and OculusVR retains ownership of the code.</p>
<p>You should really read the license to decide if you're happy with the terms before submitting your code.</p>
