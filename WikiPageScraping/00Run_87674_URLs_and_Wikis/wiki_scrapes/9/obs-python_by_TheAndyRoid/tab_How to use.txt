          <p>Once installed you should be able to create a obs source called "PythonManager" if you are not able to create the source, take a look at the obs logs and check that the python plugin was loaded successfully.</p>
<p>Once you have created the PythonManager source which really is not a source, just a way to add your own actual python scripts.</p>
<p>use <a href="https://github.com/TheAndyRoid/obs-python-scripts/blob/master/ColourSquare.py">https://github.com/TheAndyRoid/obs-python-scripts/blob/master/ColourSquare.py</a> as an example script</p>
<p>Add your script to the list of PythonScriptFiles. It should then be available as a source in obs.</p>
<p>It should be noted that python stdout and stderr will be redirected to stdOut.txt and stdErr.txt in the obs bin directory.
Check these if you have issues with your scripts.</p>
