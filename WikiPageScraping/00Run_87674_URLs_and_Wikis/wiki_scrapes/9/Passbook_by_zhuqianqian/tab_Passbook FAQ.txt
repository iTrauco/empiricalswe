          <p><strong>Here are a list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q1. Why should I prefer Passbook to other Password Management tools?</strong></p>
<p>A1: We started building Passbook because we found the current password management tools could not meet our expectations. So we decided to get one of our own so that it can have all the essential functions in one single app. Compared to the existing tools, Passbook provides:</p>
<ol>
<li>Automatic synchronization between devices using Google server. This also ensures you can get your data back if you change a new phone or reset your phone to factory.</li>
<li>Import/Export various kind of file, including aWallet exported CSV file (import only), Passbook CSV file and Passbook encrypted file.</li>
<li>Group your data by defining categories.</li>
<li>Add any kind of account without a template: you can always add or remove a field as you wish to contain exactly the information you want to save.</li>
<li>High security: Passbook uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2" rel="nofollow">PKCS#5</a> and 256 bits-key <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard" rel="nofollow">AES</a> encryption to save your data.</li>
<li>Automatic password generation (not available in version 1.0.0): You do not need to think of a complex enough password any more.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additionally, Passbook is build with the modern design pattern and it runs fluently on your devices.</p>
<p><strong>Q2. If my phone was lost, is it possible for others to crack my accounts and passwords?</strong></p>
<p>A2: Generally no. Passbook use the high security standard encryption algorithm to encrypt all the saved data and can survive the brute-force or dictionary-based attacks.</p>
<p><strong>Q3. If I forgot my master password, is there a way to recover the data?</strong></p>
<p>A3: No. Your master password is the only key to decrypt the saved data. There is no other way to decrypt the data for a recovery. So you do need to remember your master password carefully and correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Q4. I refresh another ROM to my Android device and I did not export any data, is it possible for me to get the previous data?</strong></p>
<p>A4: If you chose a synchronization server before you refresh your system, you can restore all your data to the last synchronized state by choosing that server. Passbook will automatically download the data and you need to use your original master password to unlock the accounts and passwords.</p>
<p><strong>Q5. Can I get the source code of Passbook?</strong></p>
<p>A5: Yes. Passbook is an open source application, and all the source code is available on <a href="https://github.com/zhuqianqian/Passbook">Github</a></p>
