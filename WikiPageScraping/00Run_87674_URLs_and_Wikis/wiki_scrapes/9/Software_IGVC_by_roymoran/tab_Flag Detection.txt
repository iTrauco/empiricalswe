          <p>Yes i am planning that we get this far this year, so we will need to detect the blue or red flags at the very end of the run, in order to go into the correct final lane. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, go to igvc’s website and they have a section about it in the rules pdf.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Feature Detection (Region of interest that contains blue or red colors)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a fake object in the lane we do not want to go through</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give a local navigation goal to go through the flags</p>
</li>
</ul>
