<p><em>I can't believe that it is the final week of the project! Last week I started to work on the maps functionality. All I accomplished so far is to display a map when you click on the globe icon. The center point is defined in the html template so is not related to user input/profile.
I sorted the rest of the functionality - now you enter on a start screen with only login and registration option. When logged in you find a personalized greeting, logout function, globe and pin icon and option to display pins that have been saved. I changed the colour scheme so it looks more like an old map - green, blue and light brown.</em></p>

<p>I am trying out different ways to use maps on my page. I am checking OpenStreetMap as well as GoogleMaps options. I am still encountering a lot of things I don't understand - maps specific (the difference between static and dynamic maps, processing of geospatial data) as well as Django/Python related (working with an API, getting user input, working with third party apps or libraries).</p>

<p>I woul like to display the user profile picture on the home screen. Still trying to figure out how.</p>
