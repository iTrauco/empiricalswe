<p><em>Just coming back from my holiday in Iceland on wednesday there was a lot to do this first week!</em></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I "met" my mentor Marcin on skype. We talked about the project and our expectations and how to proceed. I am very happy to have such great support during this endeavor!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will create a web application to make travel planning easier. With the help of it you can create and save a map of the country you want to go to, set a pin on the map for everything that you hear or read about and that interests you sorted by category (culture, nature, accomodation, nightlife, etc.), add your comment and/or link. The final map will help you decide which route to take, which cities or sights not to miss and to have all information in one place.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Content is key - but every child needs a name! I have named my project Zippi, inspired by a short story by german author Kurt Tucholsky (Der Reisegott Zippi). I did not find an English translation of that story online, but the title translates to “Travel God Zippi” and is a bit of a nonsense story about a good luck charm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new word found its way into my vocabulary - pseudocode. I started to write it for my program.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I spend quite a while setting up my github account and figuring out the way the whole thing works. I think I got it now!</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I downloaded Python/IDLE (Version 3.4) and familiarized with it. Also I researched online learning material to work with in the coming week.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Lets do this!</strong></p>
