          <p>The following a guide to getting started with TDB.  This guide assumes you are on the RCAC system at Purdue and have access to the jgreeley folders.  Manual installation can be found in italics.</p>
<hr/>
<p>Add the following line to your ~/.bash_profile to gain access to the preloaded modules</p>
<p><code>source /apps/group/jgreeley/modules/jgreeleyModules.sh</code></p>
<p>After this you should be able to run the following command to load TDB and its dependencies.</p>
<p><code>module load jgreeley/tdb/dev</code></p>
<p><em>If you cannot access prebuilt modules,  you can download it manually and add the "tdb" folder, containing the python files, to your PYTHONPATH and add "tools" to your PATH to manually load it.  You will also need a new enough version of ASE and XLSXWriter if you intend to export to excel.</em></p>
