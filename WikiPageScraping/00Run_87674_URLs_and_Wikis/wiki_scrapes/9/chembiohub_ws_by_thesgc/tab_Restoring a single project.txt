          <p>This guide assumes that you have backed up a project into the folder structure described in <a class="internal present" href="/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/wiki/Backing-up-projects-%28and-deleting-if-needed%29">Backing up projects (and deleting if needed)</a></p>
<p>When backing up projects, each project will be placed in a folder of its own inside of the folder specified when running the script as shown below</p>
<pre><code>            217__XXX cccccccc$pwd
            /tmp/backups/217__XXX cccccccc
	217__XXX cccccccc$ tree
	├── attachments                 #Files that were attached to compound batches
	│   ├── 11__s.xlsx              #Name is in the format [id of attachment object]__[orig filename]
	│   └── 7__exported smbcdt.xlsx 
	├── compounds.json              #JSON list of the compound objects including reference to the attachments
	├── compounds.sdf               #SDF export of above JSON list
	├── compounds.xlsx              #XLSX export of above
	├── project.json                #Project definition as a JSON for restoration
	├── fields.xlsx                 #Project definition as an XLSX sheet
	├── original_uploads            #Original datasets that were uploaded to the project (only works for new data as of May 2016
	│   ├── 12__small.sdf
	│   └── 61__filetest.xlsx
	├── editor.json                 #User list for users who are editors
	├── owner.json                  #User list for users who are owners
	└── viewer.json                 #User list for users who are editors
</code></pre>
<p>For this example, then the folder path to the project backup is what needs passing to the restore script, like this:</p>
<pre><code>python manage.py restore_single_project "/tmp/backups/217__XXX cccccccc"
</code></pre>
