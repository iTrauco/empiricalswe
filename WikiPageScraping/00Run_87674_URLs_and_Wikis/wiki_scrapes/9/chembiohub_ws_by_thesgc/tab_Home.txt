<p>###<a name="user-content-what">What is ChemBio Hub?</a></p>
<p>ChemBio Hub develops in-house applications and provides links to a variety of useful tools which can help chemical biologists, related scientists and support staff.</p>
<p>The ChemBio Hub platform is designed to accommodate a wide range of data - from chemical data (ChemiReg) to more generic collection and inventory data (InventoryReg) or any other simple tabular data format.</p>
<p>###<a name="user-content-whatisnext">How might others extend this functionality?</a></p>
<p>During development of ChemBio Hub, the backlog was managed in GitHub issues list <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/chembiohub_helpdesk/issues">https://github.com/thesgc/chembiohub_helpdesk/issues</a>.  A waffle board <a href="https://waffle.io/thesgc/chembiohub_helpdesk" rel="nofollow">https://waffle.io/thesgc/chembiohub_helpdesk</a> was used to manage and display the progress of backlog items as they were addressed.  The issues list retains all of the outstanding enhancements and defects which the project team was aware of at the time of the project closure.  They are tagged as follows:</p>
<p><strong>bugs</strong></p>
<p>20 defects are listed.  2 have high priority (856 &amp; 909),  8 have medium priority and 5 have low priority</p>
<p><strong>instance admin</strong></p>
<p>7 items are listed which relate to administration of the instance (therefore not directly relevant to end users' experience.</p>
<p><strong>managing users</strong></p>
<p>2 suggestions for improvements to how user administration is handled</p>
<p><strong>performance improvements</strong></p>
<p>3 items relating to existing experience which is slow</p>
<p><strong>robustness</strong></p>
<p>16 items are tagged which would address the robustness of the existing application.  These include error handling and warning generation, testing and small adjustments to behaviour and notification</p>
<p><strong>search</strong></p>
<p>11 items relate to improvements in the current search functionality.</p>
<p><strong>user-specified extension</strong></p>
<p>1 item captures a user requirement to extend the existing functionality</p>
<p><strong>enhancement</strong></p>
<p>11 items relate to enhancements which the team identified as useful extensions (for other users groups and for greater functionality of value to existing users)</p>
<p>###<a name="user-content-why">What problem does ChemBio Hub solve?</a>
ChemBio Hub helps researchers search and manage their data including experimental data but also other data from the processes going on in labs such as keeping track of what is in stock.</p>
<p>###<a name="user-content-how">How can I get ChemBio Hub?</a></p>
<p>ChemBio Hub is open-source software. If using the Chemical features it is under a GPL v3 license.</p>
<p>See <a class="internal present" href="/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/wiki/Installation">Installation</a> documentation here</p>
<p>###<a name="user-content-howuse">How do I run and use ChemBio Hub?</a></p>
<p>To configure your installation see <a class="internal present" href="/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/wiki/Getting-started-once-installed">Getting started once installed</a>.</p>
<p>For information on how to back-up and similar tasks, see the <a class="internal present" href="/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/wiki/Systems-administration">Systems Administration</a> page</p>
<p>End user documentation is located on our <a href="http://showyourworking.github.io/user/index.html" rel="nofollow">project site</a>.</p>
<p>###<a name="user-content-trouble">My installation is not working, what should I do?</a></p>
<p>We have gathered some common errors in our <a class="internal present" href="/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/wiki/Troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a> page. If you still have a problem, feel free to raise a <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/issues">github issue</a> and we will try to get back to you.</p>
<p>###<a name="user-content-dev">I would like to develop a new feature for ChemBio Hub</a></p>
<p>ChemBio Hub was developed to be extendible both in the front end and back end using a combination of AngularJS and Python Django.</p>
<p>The way the features work and how to set up a development environment is described in the <a class="internal present" href="/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/wiki/Technical-guide">Technical guide</a> page. If you have a problem using these docs, feel free to raise a <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/issues">github issue</a> and we will try to get back to you.</p>
