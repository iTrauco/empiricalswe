<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>The schemas on the system are updated and the back end adds an <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=uploadOptions">upload URL in the new file upload API</a> which is linked specifically to that project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/ng-chem/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=%22%24scope.success%22&amp;type=Code">controller which the file upload occurs in implements</a> the <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/cbh_core_model/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=success%28file%2C+formkey%29">function signature that is in the file upload config</a> from the back end</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The success function calls the new file upload API to <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/blob/master/cbh_core_api/views.py#L45">upload a file and link it to the project</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A permanent link to the file is then retrieved from the new <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=CBHFlowFileResource">CBHFlowFileResource</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The link is added to the JSON of the particular inventory item and the file itself can be retrieved <a href="https://github.com/thesgc/chembiohub_ws/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=CBHFlowFileDownloadResource">via the download URL with permissions checked</a>. This enables the file to be previewed as shown below:</p>
