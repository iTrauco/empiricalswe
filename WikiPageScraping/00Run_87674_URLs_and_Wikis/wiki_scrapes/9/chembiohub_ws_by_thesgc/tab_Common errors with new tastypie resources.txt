          <p>Missing the created_by field?</p>
<p>We have a Class which needs adding to your class hierarchy for the object concerned</p>
<pre><code>IntegrityError: null value in column "created_by_id" violates not-null constraint
  DETAIL:  Failing row contains (1, 2016-01-23 16:15:24.65331+00, 2016-01-23 16:15:24.653662+00, null, null,     null, null, null, null, t, null).
</code></pre>
<p>This will add the created by field to the data during the conversion of the JSON data to an object. The class is called:</p>
<p>UserHydrate and you also have to add the created by field to make it work</p>
<p>class DataFormConfigResource(UserHydrate, ModelResource):
...
created_by = fields.ForeignKey(
"cbh_core_ws.resources.UserResource", 'created_by')
class Meta:
filtering = {
"id": ALL
}
always_return_data = True</p>
<hr/>
<pre><code>  ValueError: No JSON object could be decoded when testing - no data coming back from a POST or PATCH request
</code></pre>
<p>This error arises when you have not set the meta class to return data always e.g.</p>
<pre><code>class Meta:
    filtering = {
        "id": ALL
    }
    always_return_data = True
</code></pre>
<p>###If you are trying to save a related resource:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can POST either the resource uri or the whole object or a dictionary with just the pk</li>
<li>Watch out for readonly fields - they will not be hydrated</li>
<li>Ensure the permissions are set correctly on each related resource</li>
<li>If using resource uris then your resource must actually be registered to the API</li>
<li>Currently there is no way to stop the issues whereby these resources can be posted to - you will have to explicitly block these URLs</li>
</ul>
