          <p><a href="www.getchef.com">Chef</a> is a configuration automation tool very powerfull abilites of managing multiple servers.
In Cloudefigo we use Chef as configurtion manager for all servers. By installing Chef client on our cloud instances and assign a <a href="http://learn.chef.io/" rel="nofollow">run list</a> we can automaticly configure instance configuration. More specificly we use Chef recipe that implements the encryption of the EBS volume attached to instance by setting the enviroment, packages and runs the encryption utlity.</p>
<p>###Chef server configuration:
Chef deploys in various installation modes such as managed Chef (hosted) or standalone server. We have tested Cloudefig on a managed version only but same logic can apply to standalone chef with minor configuration changes.
Once you have logged to your Chef console make sure you configured you organization details in the administration tab. In order to configure nodes and management workstation you will need the configuration files (validation.pem,knife.rb,client.rb)  so download them to you management workstation. If you are using managed Chef this can be done by using the starter kit option in the administration tab.
For more infromation please use <a href="https://learn.chef.io/legacy/get-started/" rel="nofollow">Chef Manual</a></p>
<p>###Chef client configuration
The Chef client workstation is used to manage the Chef server configration. For more infromation please read the <a href="https://docs.chef.io/knife.html" rel="nofollow">knife utility guide</a>.
Once you have setup the client with the configuration files you can connect to the management server and test it by:</p>
<pre><code>knife client list
</code></pre>
<p>Now you create a new cookbook and attach an recipe to it. We have developed a recipe for the encryption that can be downloaded from here:

<p>Cloudefigo traditioanlly uses <a href="https://code.google.com/p/cryptsetup/" rel="nofollow">Cryptsetup</a> as encryption software. But any other encryption software can be used as well with the required changes to Chef recipe.
The <a href="https://github.com/valtmanir/Cloudefigo/blob/master/Encryption-Recipe-Sample">encryption recipe</a> perform the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Install the Cryptsetup package</li>
<li>Install the xfs file system package</li>
<li>Create a directory (/encrypted) that will be used as mounting point for the encrypted volume.</li>
<li>create an encrypted volume, format it with XFS and mount it as /encrypted</li>
</ul>
