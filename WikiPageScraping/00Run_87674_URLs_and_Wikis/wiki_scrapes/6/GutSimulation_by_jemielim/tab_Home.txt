          <p>Bacterial Competition Simulation</p>
<ul>
<li>Weâ€™re using the BSim agent-based simulation package to model bacterial motility, chemotaxis, etc.</li>
<li>The Eclipse IDE works rather well for compiling code and getting the necessary libraries attached. Make sure to add BSim3.0.jar to the libraries path for the project.
**	The following features need to be added to the simulation:</li>
<li>Two different species</li>
<li>Growth rate of bacteria</li>
<li>Interaction terms between bacteria (chemotaxis)</li>
<li>Boundary conditions (first have solid boundary conditions on a cube)-maybe add in curvy boundary conditions of the actual gut.</li>
</ul>
