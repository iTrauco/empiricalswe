          <p>The OMF file format was developed for the 8-bit ORCA/M assembler.  ORCA/M (rebadged as APW) became Apple's official development environment for the IIgs and the OMF format was extended to become the native executable file format.</p>
<p>The OMF file format is documented in the ORCA/M 2.0 (IIgs) manual (Appendix B: File Formats) and the GS/OS Reference (Appendix F: Object Module Format). The 8-bit ORCA/M 4.1 manual also contains file format info, but only to the extent that it's used in 8-bit ORCA/M.</p>
