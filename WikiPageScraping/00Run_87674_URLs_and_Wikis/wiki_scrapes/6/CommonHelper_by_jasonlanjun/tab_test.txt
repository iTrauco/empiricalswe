          <p>I’m proud to say that I’ve lived in Burnaby for most of my life so when it comes to doing businesses in Burnaby I’ve always been one to support the local community. Burnaby’s financial position seems to be very strong, which means more and more people are conducting business within Burnaby so it is important for your business to have a strong professional web presence.</p>
<p>If you are starting a new or own an existing business or you are thinking about operating in Burnaby, you might want to consider visiting the City of Burnaby’s website.

<p>notary_publicWe’ve assisted several Burnaby businesses in developing their website and have helped them understand the importance of creating a user-friendly mobile website that people can find.
Rikki Puri Notary Public’s website is a great example of a growing Burnaby Business. They saw the importance of building a professional website that offers all the services they provide and wanted a professional looking website that works on a mobile device.</p>
<p>A quick meeting was all that was needed to help us understand their goals and services and the project was on its way. Creating a professional website for businesses in Burnaby (or any city for that matter) doesn’t have to be complicated.</p>
<p>Once the overall look and feel is agreed upon, we start gathering content.</p>
<p>burnaby website homepageFinishing Stage wanted a new website and had wanted a consistent brand for his thriving business. Our graphic designer came up with a few options where the client gave feed back as to what elements he liked and disliked and a new look was delivered.</p>
<p>From here we designed a beautiful responsive website for his Burnaby-based business.</p>

When looking for good content, you never want to take pictures from Google Images and copy them onto your website or post. This is a very bad thing and Google will find out if you do… Don’t believe me? Read this article.</p>
