          <p>When a faked Context is created, it instantiates a fake tracing service.</p>
<p>Any calls to the tracing service made in your plugins or workflows, the string value of the trace will be appended to the fake tracing service's trace property.</p>
<p>If you want to read the trace, you can call the DumpTrace() method on the fake tracing service, like this:
<code>Console.WriteLine(FakeContext.GetFakeTracingService().DumpTrace());</code></p>
