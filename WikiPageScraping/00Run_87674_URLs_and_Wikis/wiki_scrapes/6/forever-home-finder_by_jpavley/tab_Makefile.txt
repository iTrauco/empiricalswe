          <p>The Makefile is perhaps the most difficult to understand file in the whole FHF project. But Makefile have been around forever and work well.</p>
<p>Important Note: Makefiles expect actual tabs, not spaces. If you get this message:
<code>Makefile:5: *** missing separator. Stop.</code>
You have spaces where you should have tabs in the left margin!</p>
<p>FHF makefile starts out with two macros:</p>
<p><code>REPORTER = list</code>
<code>MOCHA_OPTS = --ui bdd â€“c</code></p>
<p>REPORTER is an alias for a list of files in the root directory
MOCHA_OPTS is an alias for a list of command line arguments to send to mocha
(Basically set the output of mocha to BDD formatting, not TDD.)</p>
<p>Next the FHF makefile specifies a target (test) and set of commands to execute when that target is called.</p>
<p>The test target clears the screen, lists the files in the home directory, sends the command line arguments to mocha, executes all the tests in the tests directory, and then says its done</p>
<p>The last line of the FHF makefile is</p>
<p><code>.PHONEY: test</code></p>
<p>The phony directive tells make not to confuse the target <em>test</em> with a file named <em>test</em> and makes sure that the target <em>test</em> is always considered by make to be out-of-date.</p>
<p>Whew!</p>
