          <p>The project contains a few enums (4 at time of writing). Enums were created instead of tables because they contain little data (potential rows) and data is static and will only be added in very small numbers to the already existing ones.</p>
<p>The enums are:</p>
<ul>
<li>continents: and id is mapped to the name of a continent</li>
<li>games: an id is mapped to an array containing the name of the game in first position and whether the game is a multiplayer game or not in second position</li>
<li>prediction_types: an id is mapped to an array containing the prediction type reference (name/type) in first position, the points that such a prediction is worth when done correctly in second position and a prediction level identifier in third position (MATCH_PREDICTION or ROUND_PREDICTION or AGNOSTIC_PREDICTION)</li>
<li>round_types: an id mapped to an array containing the stage name or reference in first position and the prediction point multiplier in second position</li>
</ul>
