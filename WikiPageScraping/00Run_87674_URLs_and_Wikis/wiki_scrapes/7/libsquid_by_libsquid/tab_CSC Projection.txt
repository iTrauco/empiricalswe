<p>The COBE quadrilateralized spherical cube (CSC) projection attempts to distort the [TSC Projection](TSC Projection) to make it approximately equal area.  This is done with a 6th order polynomial expansion which stretches each face to account for the differences in area.  This modification produces good results without the abrupt discontinuities of the [QSC Projection](QSC Projection).  This projection was used by the Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) project to display maps of the cosmic microwave background as measured by the COBE satellite.  While producing visually appealing results, this projection involves more intensive computation to render because of the many calculations involved in the polynomial expansion.  Another drawback is that the results are only approximately equal area.  Finally, the forward and reverse calculations are not exact inverses, errors can be as large as 24 arcseconds and the rms error is 6.6 arcseconds.</p>
<p>The formulas for the computation of the CSC Projection were taken from Calabretta (2002),
