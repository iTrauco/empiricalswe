          <p>The resolution level of a [squid index](SQUID Index) is the quad-tree "depth" of that index.
The six base <a href="Face">faces</a> are at resolution level 0.  A 64 bit squid index will get you to
a resolution level of 30.  The resolution level, k, can be computed from a squid index using the
following formula:</p>
<p>k=floor(log(squid)/log(4) - 1)</p>
<p>The number of [quad-tree pixels](XY Coordinates) on the side of a face is given by the
following formula:</p>
<p>nside=2^k</p>
<p>The number of pixels on the entire sphere at a particular resolution level is given by
the following formula:</p>
<p>npix=6*(nside^2)=6*(2^(2k))</p>
<p>The image below shows the parameters related to some selected resolution levels.  The value
given for theta pix is the square root of the pixel area.  This value will vary somewhat if
the projection being used is not equal area.</p>
