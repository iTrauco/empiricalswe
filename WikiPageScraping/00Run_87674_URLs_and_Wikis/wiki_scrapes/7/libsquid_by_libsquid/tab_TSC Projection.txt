<p>The Tangental Spherical Cube (TSC) projection is the most basic projection supported by the LibSQUID library.  The TSC projection is created by projecting the sphere from its center point onto an enclosing cube sharing the same center point.  The TSC projection has the property of being gnomonic on each of its faces, meaning that it displays all great circles as straight lines.  This could be considered a useful property for navigation or data in which the user wishes to detect features that would appear as straight lines on a sphere (roads, satellite tracks).  The primary drawback of this projection is that it is far from being equiareal.  This may make it unsuitable for database schemes in which the user wishes to evenly sample data taken across the sphere.  Nevertheless, the TSC projection is mathematically very simple and easily computed, making calculations very fast.</p>
<p>The formulas for the computation of the TSC Projection were taken from Calabretta (2002),
