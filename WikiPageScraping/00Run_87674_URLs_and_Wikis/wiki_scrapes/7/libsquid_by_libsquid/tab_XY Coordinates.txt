          <p>Within the LibSQUID library, there are a few different types of xy coordinates that are
referred to in the code.</p>
<p>The first type is the "quad-tree" coordinates, (qx,qy).  These are the coordinates given when the
faces are divided into tiles using the quad-tree scheme.  They are the x,y coordinates
contained within the [SQUID Index](SQUID Index).</p>
<p>The second type is the "face" coordinates, (fx,fy).  Here the x and y coordinate is given by a
floating point number that goes from 0 to 1 across the face.  An (fx,fy) of (0,0) is the
bottom left corner of the face and (1,1) is the upper right corner of the face.  The
face coordinates are related to the quad-tree coordinates by the following formulas:<br/>
fx=(qx+0.5)/nside<br/>
fy=(qy+0.5)/nside<br/>
Where: nside=2*k and k=[resolution level](Resolution Level)
Note that the quad-tree coordinates are quantized integers while the face coordinates
are floating point numbers.  Therefore you can always go from quad-tree coordinates to
face coordinates, but not necessarily the other direction.</p>
<p>The third type is the "tile" coordinates.  These coordinates are used when a squid tile
is further subdivided into pixels (an image).  The pixel coordinates within a tile
(tx,ty) are related to the face coordinates using the following formulas:<br/>
fx=((tx/tside)+qx)/nside<br/>
fy=((ty/tside)+qy)/nside<br/>
Where: tside is the number of pixels on the side of a tile, and nside=2*k<br/>
So, for a squid tile image, the center of the lower left pixel is (tx,ty)=(0.5,0.5)
and the center of the upper right pixel is (tx,ty)=(tside-0.5,tside-0.5).</p>
