The standard face numbering scheme is shown in the image above.  Face 0 is centered on the north
pole while face 5 is centered on the south pole.  Faces 1-4 cover the equatorial region.
The center longitude of face 1 is determined by the [LON_POLE](LibSQUID Library) macro in the
libsquid.h file in the base repository.  The default for LON_POLE is 0.  The [LON_DIR](LibSQUID Library)
macro determines whether longitude increases or decreases with increasing x.  The default
is -1 which is set for celestial coordinates.</p>
<p>The faces themselves have a squid [resolution level](Resolution Level) of 0.  Face 0 would
have a squid index of 8 and face 5 would have a squid index of 14.  A squid index below 8 would
be invalid, as would a squid index of 15.</p>
<p>The "face" (x,y) coordinates used in the LibSQUID code are floating point numbers that go from
0 to 1 across the face.  See the section on [XY Coordinates](XY Coordinates) for clarification.</p>
