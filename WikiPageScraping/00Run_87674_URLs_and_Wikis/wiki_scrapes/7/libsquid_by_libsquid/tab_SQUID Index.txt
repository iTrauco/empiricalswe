          <p>The LibSQUID Quad-Tree index, or simply "squid", is an integer that, given a particular
map projection, contains all the information needed to represent a location on the sphere.
The squid doesn't just represent a point on a sphere, but a fully defined region on the
sphere including the center and borders.  A user may use this information to provide an
index scheme for spherical points in a database or use the squid to define a region
occupied by a full image.</p>

<p>We will use the image above to demonstrate how the squid quad-tree index is constructed.
The projection used in the illustration is the HSC projection, but the underlying projection
is not important at this point.  The quad-cube is divided into six <a href="Face">faces</a>.  The
standard face numbering scheme is shown.  Face 0 is centered on the north pole while face
5 is centered on the south pole.  Faces 1-4 cover the equatorial region.  The faces themselves
compose the six squid tiles at [resolution level](Resolution Level) 0.  In the illustration, face
1 is further
divided into four squid tiles at resolution level 1.  The upper right tile is then further
divided into four sub-tiles at resolution level 2.  At resolution level 2, face 1 would be
divided into a 4x4 grid of 16 tiles.  If the lower left sub-tile in the 4x4 grid is considered
to be at position (0,0), then the red "x" shown in the illustration would be at position
(x,y)=(2,2).  Technically the x,y coordinates listed here are the "quad-tree" coordinates,
see the section on [xy coordinates](XY Coordinates) for clarification.
The squid index at position "x" is then composed in the following manner:</p>

<p>In the squid index, the top most bit is always 1.  This is to ensure that the current
resolution level is always encoded in the index and that all squid indices are unique
regardless of the resolution level.  The next three bits encode the face number.  The bits
following the initial 4 top-most bits encode the x,y position within the face.  The
number of bits that follow are always 2*k, where k is the resolution level.  In the example
above, we are at resolution level 2, so the x and y coordinate both require 2 bits each.
The bits that encode the x and y location are interleaved in the manner shown in the example
above.</p>
