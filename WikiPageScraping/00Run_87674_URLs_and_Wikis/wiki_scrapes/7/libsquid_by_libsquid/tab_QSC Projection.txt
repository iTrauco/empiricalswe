<p>The quadrilateralized spherical cube (QSC) projection provides the exact formulation for an equal area spherical cube.  Basically it does exactly what the [CSC Projection](CSC Projection) attempts to do.  The main drawback with the QSC projection is that there is a mathematical discontinuity across the diagonals of each face.  This can be seen when linear features make sudden sharp changes as they travel across the cube faces.  This projection is much faster than the [CSC Projection](CSC Projection) to calculate, but not quite as fast as the [TSC Projection](TSC Projection).</p>
<p>The formulas for the computation of the QSC Projection were taken from Calabretta (2002),
