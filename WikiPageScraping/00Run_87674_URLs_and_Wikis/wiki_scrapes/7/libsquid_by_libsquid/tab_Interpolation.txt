          <p>The LibSQUID library supports four types of pixel interpolation when dealing with imagery.
The first is simply taking the nearest neighbor to the pixel in question.  The second is
to perform bilinear interpolation using the four nearest pixels.  The third is to do a cubic
spline interpolation using a 3x3 grid around the x,y location.  The fourth is to do a cubic
convolution using a 3x3 grid around the x,y location.  The nearest neighbor calcuation is
obviously the fastest, followed closely by the bilinear interpolation.  The cubic interpolation
methods take somewhat longer.  The source code for the interpolation algorithms are located
in the libsquid_utils.c file.</p>
<p>The image below shows a comparison of the results for the various interpolation algorithms
mentioned above.<br/>
