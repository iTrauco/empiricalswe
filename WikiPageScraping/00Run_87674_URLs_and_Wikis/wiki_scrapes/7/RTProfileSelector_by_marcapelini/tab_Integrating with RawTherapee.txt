          <p>Now that you have RTProfileSelector properly installed on your computer, you need to make some changes in RawTherapee so that it knows that you want it to use RTProfileSelector  as your <em>custom profile builder</em>.</p>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>Open RawTherapee's "Preferences" dialogue and in the "Image Processing" tab set the field "Custom Processing Profile Builder" to the full path of the RTPS executable.</li>
<li>Here is how it is set on my Windows computer (please note the quotes!):
<img alt="" src="images/rt_cpp.png"/>
</li>
<li>And here my Ubuntu configuration:
<img alt="" src="images/rt_cpp_ubuntu.png"/>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you <strong>have at least one</strong> custom processing profile (placed within "My Profiles" in RT) and that it is <strong>set as your default profile</strong>.  This is necessary for RTPS to automatically detect the folder where RT stores its custom profiles, so that you can later assign rules for them.  If you don't have any custom profiles, or your current default profile is not a custom one, you can enter that information manually in RTPS's configuration file (see below), but the automatic method is preferable.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is how you can create a custom profile and assign it as your default (if that's not already the case for your RT installation):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open any raw file that supposedly is a good candidate for a "normal" or "regular" photo (for which a default profile would be a good starting point), then click the "Save current profile" button:
<img alt="" src="images/save_default.png"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Give this profile any name you want (in this example, I named it "My Default Profile":
<img alt="" src="images/my_def_prof.png"/></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Go to the "Preferences" dialogue and select "My Default Profile" (it will appear under the "My Profiles" submenu) as the default processing profile for raw photos:
<img alt="" src="images/my_def_prof_dialog.png"/></p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
<p>(<em>Skip this step if you followed the instructions above</em>)</p>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, if for any reason you don't want to use a custom profile as your default, you can skip the steps above and edit <strong>RTProfileSelector.ini</strong> entering the folder where RT stores your custom profiles.  Note that this information is dependent on your installation, version of RT, and operating system, so the automatic method above is to be preferred.</li>
</ul>
<p>Open <strong>RTProfileSelector.ini</strong> and add/uncomment the key "RTCustomProfilesPath" and enter the full path name for the custom profiles folder. Here's where I located the folder on my Windows install:
<img alt="" src="images/rtps_customfolder.png"/>
(hint: open a Windows Explorer window, type in "<strong>%appdata%\..\Local</strong>", locate RawTheraee's data folder and within it the "<strong>profiles</strong>" folder!).</p>
