          <p>This Windows Batchscript does three things:
*It will create the entire build environment required to allow you to build ffmpeg for Windows on a Windows machine. This build environment include software such as MinGW, msys, git, mercurial, svn
*It will download and compile a whole bunch of libraries and necessary software required to add additional features and codecs to ffmpeg
*And finally, it will use all of the above to compile ffmpeg</p>
<p>After building the environment it get and compile all tools. All tools get static compiled, no external .dlls needed.</p>
<p>For using it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the file, and copy it in your target folder. In that folder all compiler and tools get installed. Please look that you use a folder without space characters. A good place is: c:\mingw</li>
<li>double click the media-autobuild_suite.bat file</li>
<li>select if you want to compile for Windows 32 bit, 64 bit or both</li>
<li>select if you want to compile non free tools like "fdk aac"</li>
<li>select the numbers of CPU (cores) you want to use</li>
<li>Wait a little bit, and hopefully after a while you found all your "*.exe" Tools under local32\bin, or local64\bin</li>
</ul>
<p>The Script write a ini-file witch you can edit, so you don't need to follow the questions every time.</p>
<p>For all you need ~5 GB disk space.
The script doesn't build any registry key or system variables, when you don't need it any more you can delete the folder and your system will be clean.
Build all from the begin take around ~3 hours.</p>
<p>Later when you need only some new builds, delete the .exe files under local32\bin|local64\bin, some libs only produce *.a files, when you want to build them new, then delete that one. ffmpeg, x264, x265, libvpx, libbluray, sox and some other tools have automatic update from git, so by them you don't need to delete files or folders.</p>
<p>For saving space you can delete, after compiling, all source folders (except the folders with a "-git", "-svn" or "-hg" on end) in build32 and build64.
Have fun!</p>

<p><a href="#">This pre-compiled 32-bit ffmpeg.exe including Intel QuickSync support</a> was compiled by running the .bat file on a Windows 7 64-bit machine with the following options provided:
*Select msys2 system = 64 bit
*Select build target system = 32 bit
*Build non-free? = free binaries (only)
*Build ffmpeg binary = yes (static)
*Build ffmpeg new when lib has updated = yes
*Include QuickSync = yes
*Static mp4box = no
*Static mplayer = no
*Static mpv = no
*Static mkv = no
*CPU threads = 3 (I have a quad-core processor)
*Delete source folders = no
*Strip compiled files = yes
*Pack compiled files = no</p>
