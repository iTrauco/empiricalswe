<p>Tired of setting up the framework your project? Do you forget where to put configurations? Confused what libraries are required to get the framework up and running? Sample-skeleton-projects is all about <em>saving time</em>.</p>
<p>The modules in sample-skeleton-projects are all standalone and independent projects that are created using the bare requirements of a particular framework. By bare requirements, it means that the libraries, jars and configurations that a framework needs to , lets say, print a message "Hello World" on the console, or  just greet you with a nice message on the browser, are all added and configured properly. So you can run these modules right out of the box !</p>
<p>If you want to use any of the module, all you need to do is clone the repository, import that as a standalone maven project (remove the other modules if you want to) and voila ! You now have the framework ready and alive and you can start building on top of it. This saves a lot of hair pulling time that is usually spent on configuring and gathering required libraries and the hit/trial method to configure a framework.</p>
