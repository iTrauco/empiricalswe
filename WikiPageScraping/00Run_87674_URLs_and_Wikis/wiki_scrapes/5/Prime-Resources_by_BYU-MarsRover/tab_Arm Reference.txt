          <p>#Arm Design Reference#</p>
<p>The arm will have a gripper, or prime end effector. The arm will also have a set of secondary effectors that will be used to do minor or unique tasks such as rotating knobs, flipping switches, and core sampling/drilling hardware (probably attached to the fore-arm and not on the end of the wrist elements).</p>
