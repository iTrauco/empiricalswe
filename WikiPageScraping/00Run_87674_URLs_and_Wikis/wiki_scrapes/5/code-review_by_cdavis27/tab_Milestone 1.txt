          <p>The majority of my time has been spent learning how to set up a Python/Django project and how to use angular.  The initial set up took quite a while, but after going through that process any other project will now be much easier to start. Once that was completed I started working on the HTML and CSS. I have most of the main UI elements in place, though they are not quite as pretty as I hope the finished product will be.</p>
<p>Once I had the basic HTML and CSS finished I started making the program dynamic using Angular. Since the backend is not set up yet, I hardcoded some project data that I could use to populate the page. The projects page is now filled with the different hardcoded projects. Selecting one of those will bring you to a page that displays all the files within that project. Clicking on a specific page will bring you to a page that contains a large text field. I donâ€™t have it filling the text field with content yet, but the text field does have syntax highlighting.</p>
<p><strong>Finished</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Basic layout for the entire program</li>
<li>Project page navigation</li>
<li>Text area has correct syntax highlighting</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Currently Working on</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Various small modal boxes</li>
<li>Adding comments to a line of code</li>
<li>Highlighting the gutter where a comment has been added</li>
</ul>
