</h2>
<p>Students are graded based on both their team's execution of their startup and on their individual performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Team performance (50%)</p>
<ul>
<li>Completion of all homework and deliverables (Note: teams will be graded on the quality of their deliverables but not on whether or not they plan to spin out their startup.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Individual performance (50%)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Pop Quizzes (25%) (if you miss more than 1 pop quiz, you lose one-half letter grade, see below)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peer feedback (15%)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adherence to <a href="https://github.com/cornelltech/studio/wiki/Studio-Policies">Studio Policies</a> (10%)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Things to note about your grade:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>No cell phones or laptops (take notes in a notebook)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Attendance is mandatory. If you miss class, homework, quizzes, and do not complete the make-up assignment your final grade will drop a one-half letter grade (A drops to B+, B drops to C+, etc.) for each missed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you miss any class, homework, or quizzes quiz <em>for any reason</em>, you can make up the class by completing an optional make-up assignment (see below)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You do not need to share why you missed class with the instructor or ask for an excused absence, just ask for and complete a make-up assignment to receive full credit for the absent by emailing David and cc Khoa</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make-up assignments are due before the next class, just like homework</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that the make-up assignments are <strong>more</strong> work than the class time you missed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you miss more than one Sprint you cannot get a higher grade than a C.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are unable to participate in a sprint work session with your team, you are allowed one (1) makeup without penalty to your grade. You must propose and present a solo sprint project of roughly the same amount of work that we would expect you to accomplish during the sprint (~8 hrs). Projects must be approved by the Khoa and your team members. To prevent your team from falling behind, it is recommended that you complete your project prior to the missed sprint. You must at least notify the Khoa and propose a project prior to the missed sprint. If you miss more than one sprint work session, you cannot get a higher grade than a C.</p>
<ul>
<li>Negative peer feedback will impact your grade negatively by 15%.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you disrupt the learning experience of your classmates, you will be removed from the class and receive a failing grade. Disruptions in class include the following unprofessional behaviors:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rude in class</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Terrible teammate</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Disrespectful / disengaged in class or Crit (no cell phone or laptops in class or Crit)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Late to / absent from class or Crit</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Any attempts to circumvent this policy will result in an additional three (3) absences with no option for making it up (i.e., just be honest!).</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Final Presentations:</strong></p>
<p>Final presentations on May 10th are the equivalent of your final exam. Please keep in mind that if you are competing for a startup award, your entire team must be present for the May 10th session.</p>
