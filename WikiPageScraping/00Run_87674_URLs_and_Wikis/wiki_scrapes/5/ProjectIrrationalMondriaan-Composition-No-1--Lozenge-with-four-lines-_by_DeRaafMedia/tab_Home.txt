          <p>Welcome to the ProjectIrrationalMondriaan-Composition-No-1--Lozenge-with-four-lines- wiki!</p>
<p>Just a few links to help you to get things installed the right way.</p>
<p>You just need to have <a href="http://openframeworks.cc/" rel="nofollow">openFrameworks</a> installed.</p>
<p>For Mac OS X systems follow this <a href="http://openframeworks.cc/setup/xcode/" rel="nofollow">link --&gt;</a></p>
<p>For Windows follow this <a href="http://openframeworks.cc/setup/codeblocks/" rel="nofollow">link --&gt;</a></p>
<p>For Linux follow this <a href="http://openframeworks.cc/setup/linux-codeblocks/" rel="nofollow">link --&gt;</a></p>
<p>I write my software as <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/downloads/" rel="nofollow">Xcode projects</a>. The 'important' part of these 'Projects' reside in the <code>/src</code> directory. Sometimes I made a few changes in some libraries used. I will try to include those changes.</p>
<p>Create a new openFrameworks project (tip: always try to use the <a href="http://www.openframeworks.cc/tutorials/introduction/002_projectGenerator.html" rel="nofollow">projectGenerator</a> to create new openFrameworks projects), in the directory created in <code>/of-0.x.x/apps/myApps/ProjectName/</code> there will be a directory called <code>/src</code>. Copy the files from the repositories <code>/src</code> directory to yours, and most of the time it should be good to go.</p>
<p>If any addons are used then you can find them in the src directory. Put those addon directories in the addons directory of openFrameworks and import them in your Xcode project.</p>
<p>Have fun coding!</p>
