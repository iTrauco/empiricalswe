          <p>Hey, hi, hello :)</p>
<p>Karolina, 25 years old, graduated from University of Silesia (Polish studies), scholar in <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/learnitgirl/" rel="nofollow">"Learn IT, Girl!"</a>, very happy and excited - that's me.
Mihai, from Romania, he could teach a potato to code - that's my mentor.
Creating a program which will help with organising and managing the work of my organization. It will control the execution of multiple tasks at one time and it will designate a person to a task based on her/his abilities - that's my goal.</p>
<p>First week I was:</p>
<ul>
<li>creating an account on GITHub,</li>
<li>installing GIT and learning how to use it,</li>
<li>installing PHPStorm and learning how to use it,</li>
<li>reading first chapters of PHP tutorial (variables, strings, loops and other),</li>
<li>writing my first lines in PHP.</li>
</ul>
<p>Second week I was practising everything what I've learned and I was reading more chapters of PHP tutorial (arrays, functions, conditional statements and other).</p>
