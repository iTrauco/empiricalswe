          <p>MythtvPlayerForAndroid (MythTV Player) collects no user data
whatsoever.</p>
<p>Of course it communicates with the MythTV backend defined in
the Settings page. Information is retrieved by the app from
the backend using the MythTV Services API. That information
is never forwarded or uploaded anywhere else, PERIOD.</p>
<p>In the event that the app fails and the phone/tablet offers
to report that information, please say yes -- that's how
things get fixed. Google gets a stacktrace listing the programs
and lines where the failure occurred. NO user data accompanies
the stacktrace. Users may optionally add information, and
adding things like what was being attempted would be
appreciated. Android also sends the Application version,
Android version and Device name (that's true for any application,
not just this one.)</p>
