          <p>###Overview
Items listed here should help users solve basic <em>MythTV</em> configuration
problems. In no way, is this intended to replace their
<a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">Wiki</a>. The search box on that
page is quite helpful.</p>
<p>###1st things 1st
What version of <em>MythTV</em> is running? The answer can be found by typing:
<code>mythbackend --version</code> on the backend. The relevant line looks like this:</p>
<pre>MythTV Version : v0.27-x-gxxxxxxx
</pre>
<p>and the version <strong>must</strong> be <code>v0.27</code> through <code>v0.28</code>.</p>
<p><code>mythbackend</code> <em>must</em> be started with proper settings for the environemtal variables
<code>LANG</code> and <code>LC_ALL</code>. Settings like: <code>de_DE.UTF-8</code> or <code>en_US.UTF-8</code> are correct.</p>
<p>###Where are the log files?
This is a very good question because there isn't a simple answer.</p>
<p>Before even explaining how to find them, a special note (if this isn't
done, looking at logs could be a waste of time.)
<em>MythTV</em> doesn't log all the messages used by this application by default. Their logging
must be turned on. Type: <code>mythbackend --setverbose upnp</code> (the backend must
be running 1st.) To turn the messages off, type: <code>mythbackend --setverbose general</code>.
Or, the backend can be restarted with the <code>-v upnp</code> option set. In 0.28, a new
logging component was added, use: <code>upnp,http</code> for additional information. Or, for
even more detail use: <code>upnp:debug,http:debug</code>.</p>
<p>Log files are stored in different places. Their directory and filename are the
choice of the distribution and/or the user. If the location is unknown, type:
<code>ps ax | grep mythbackend | grep -v grep</code> on the backend. The result
will look (in part) like one of these lines:</p>
<pre>mythbackend --logpath /var/log/mythtv
mythbackend --syslog local7
</pre>
<p>If <code>--logpath</code> is used, then look in the directory following it for the most active file
named <code>mythbackend.&lt;timestamp&gt;.&lt;pid&gt;.log</code>.
If <code>--syslog</code> is used, then logs are written to <code>/var/log/syslog</code>, <strong>unless</strong>
<code>rsyslog</code> is configured, in which case the typical place for those logs is
back in <code>/var/log/mythtv</code> and the file name is <code>mythbackend.log</code>.
There are good details on <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Logging" rel="nofollow">logging</a>
and for <a href="http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Simple_rsyslog_Configuration" rel="nofollow">rsyslog</a>
in the <em>MythTV Wiki</em> pages. Another tool to use (if using <code>--syslog</code> and
<code>systemd</code> ) is <code>journalctl --unit=mythtv-backend</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, the most frequently used <em>MythTV</em> log for this application is the backend log.
However, users may be asked to look for others, for example, the <code>mythtrasncode</code>log.
The good news is that it's probably in the same directory found above.</p>
<p>###No playback: <em>MythTV</em> logs report missing or inaccessible streaming files
Look for errors with text like the following:</p>
<pre>Error: Could not create builtinStorage Group directory '/home/mythtv/.mythtv/tmp/hls' for 'Streaming'
</pre>
<p>If no streaming storage group is defined (which is OK,) then a path to a built-in
one will be developed. Or, if there's a need to store the streaming files
elsewhere (due to disk space restrictions,) then
use the <code>mythtv-setup</code> program on the Master Backend to configure (or repair)
a <code>Streaming</code> storage group with one or more directories. An example would be
<code>/mnt/mythtv/streaming</code>.</p>
<p>In either case, user <code>mythtv</code>, must have read-write permissions on the directory
chosen and be its owner and group.</p>
<p>###Recordings don't play
If a distribution or user built <em>MythTV</em>
and run <code>configure</code> without the <code>--enable-libx264</code> switch, attempts to transcode and stream
video will fail. A clue would be text in the backend log file that looks like this:</p>
<pre>HLS(): Command '/usr/bin/mythtranscode --hls --hlsstreamid 48 --verbose general --loglevel info --syslog local7' returned 255
</pre>
