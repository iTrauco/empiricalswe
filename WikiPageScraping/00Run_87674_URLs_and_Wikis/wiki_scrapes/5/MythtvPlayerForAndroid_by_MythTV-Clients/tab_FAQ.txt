          <p>###Is there a quick start guide?
Yes, this it it!</p>
<p>On the Home page, swipe right and select <code>Settings</code>
on the<em>Navigation Drawer</em>.
Select <code>Master Backend Address</code> and enter its IP address.</p>
<p>There is also an option to change the <code>Master Backend Port</code>. It
is unlikly that anything other than the default 6544 will be used.
If the port was changed on the <em>MythTV</em> backend, then change it
here too.</p>
<p>Finally, the best playback results have been seen with an
external player, so uncheck the <code>Internal Player</code> box. <em>VLC</em>
is one external player known to work well. It's available at
the <em>Play Store</em>.</p>
<p>###Troubleshooting connection/results problems
If the <em>MythTV</em> backend(s) are <a href="MythTV-Configuration-Suggestions">properly configured</a>,
then please see: <a href="Connection-Troubleshooting-Guidelines">Connection Troubleshooting Guidelines</a></p>
