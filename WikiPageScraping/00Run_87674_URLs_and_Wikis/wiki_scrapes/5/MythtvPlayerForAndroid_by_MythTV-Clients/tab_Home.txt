          <p><em>MythTV Player For Android</em> is currently available to alpha testers only.
Users must have a working <em>MythTV</em> backend running 0.27.6 or 0.28-rc1 and
<em>Android</em> version 4.2 or above.</p>
<p>Please see the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mythtv.android" rel="nofollow">Google Play Store</a> for a description of this app.</p>
<p><strong>Special note</strong>. In a previous life, <em>MythTV Android Frontend</em> received a
number of negative comments about Live TV playback. This app, as well as its
predecessor, <strong>DOES NOT PLAY Live TV</strong>. It can't because it connects to the
MythTV backend via the Services API. That API runs on the backend and it
does not have support for Live TV. The Services API is not controlled by
the developer of this app.</p>
<p>To become an alpha tester, visit <a href="https://play.google.com/apps/testing/org.mythtv.android" rel="nofollow">this link</a>
Then download the app to your device.</p>
