          <p>#Sensor Nodes#</p>
<p>I started by ordering a couple of the Moteinos from lowpowerlabs to test them out. They are awesome and tiny.  Perfect for what I'm trying to do. I soldered all the headers on the first 2 so I could do the breadboard thing and get a bunch of stuff tested.  I plan to order more for the actual sensor nodes and put them in some kind of nice enclosure.</p>
<p>Since I will be using MQTT (Mosquitto) for getting the sensor information to the openHAB server, I needed to build a payload structure that is consistent and carries all the info I need to get to the Ethernet gateway. Items needed are:</p>
<ul>
<li>NodeID</li>
<li>NetworkID</li>
<li>SensorID (maybe not needed)</li>
<li>SensorDataVar</li>
<li>SensorDataVar2</li>
<li>SensorDataVar3</li>
</ul>
<p>The SensorDataVars will be various readings from sensors.  I have 3 listed as I may have more than a single sensor in a node. Temp, Humidity, Light for instance.  I may add more but for now that should suffice. Whatever happens, I need the payload to have the same structure across all sensor nodes.</p>
<p>Each node needs a unique NodeID to differentiate the messages to the RFM gateway.  I will use the various portions of the payload to generate a unique number to pass to Mosquitto.</p>
<p>Just ordered two of these enclosures:</p>

<p>They should fit everything including batteries and Moteino nicely.  Shipping was $13 on an $18 order .. so that sux.  They are in Kentucky and I'm in North Carolina.</p>
<p><strong>01/06/2015</strong> -- I have gotten the LowPower.h library integrated with my sketches.  For now I can only get the sensors to sleep for a max of 8 seconds at a time.  I should be able to loop through this and basically sleep for as long as I need.  Here are the lines needed to put the Moteino to sleep.</p>
<pre><code>#include &lt;LowPower.h&gt;

void setup() {
//setup stuff goes here
//nothing needed for sleep
}

void loop() {
    LowPower.powerDown(SLEEP_8S, ADC_CONTROL_OFF, BOD_OFF); //Sleeps for 8 seconds
    // read sensor data or whatever after this
}
</code></pre>
<p>Will update with added code to put the radio to sleep later.  I haven't updated the repository yet as I'm still working on it. I'll update later this week.</p>
