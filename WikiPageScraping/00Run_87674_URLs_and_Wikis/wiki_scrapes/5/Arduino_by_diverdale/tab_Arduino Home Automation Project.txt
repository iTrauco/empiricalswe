          <p>#Arduino/Moteino Home Automation Project#</p>
<p>I am undertaking building a home automation solution.  The first step will be home monitoring.  I will be building sensor nodes using the outstanding Moteino product with the RFM69HW chip for communication at 915mhz. The Gateways will be Arduinos. One of my main goals is to have them in a tidy little enclosure that I can mount around the house.  I'll even work on some weatherproof ones and some for my workshop.  Eventually, I'll move into lights and receptacles but I'm starting with monitoring.</p>
<p>###Sensor Node Requirements###</p>
<ul>
<li>Small</li>
<li>Low Power</li>
<li>Battery Powered</li>
</ul>
<p>###Gateway Requirements###</p>
<ul>
<li>Cheap</li>
<li>Easy to Program</li>
<li>Active Community for Support</li>
</ul>
<p>I chose the Moteino for the sensor nodes mainly for the size and the ability to get the RFM69HW bundled. These guys are TINY!</p>
