          <p>###Troubleshooting###</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> There are no html files in my build or dist folders!</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Be sure to have run the templater with <code>gulp template first</code>, or at least create jade files in the jade folder that extends the base.jade partial with the same name as your campaign</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Config task seems to be failing... it can't find the config.json file?</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Delete the node_modules folder and then run npm install again. This sometimes happens if the dependencies have not fully resolved, yet no error message may be shown.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Getting errors about things not being found when running node</p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Weirdness in that the modules do not get added to dependencies so run, so delete node_modules folder then re-run installation steps.</p>
<p><strong>Q.</strong> Error while running <strong>distribute</strong></p>
<p><strong>A.</strong> Sometimes (in Windows) node will fail to delete a folder due to Explorer keeping certain files in it's cached memory (such as thumbs.db). If you encounter this, try and close down any app that uses those files then re-run the dist task.</p>
