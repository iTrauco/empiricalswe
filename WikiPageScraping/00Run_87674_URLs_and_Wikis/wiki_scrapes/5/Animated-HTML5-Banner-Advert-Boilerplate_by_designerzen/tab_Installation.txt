<p>After installing <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/" rel="nofollow">NodeJS</a> on your machine,</p>
<p>Open a Command Prompt in the directory of your project and enter :</p>
<p><strong>Mac / Linux :</strong>
<code>sudo npm install</code></p>
<p><strong>Windows :</strong>
<code>npm install</code></p>
<p>This will create a folder called <em>"node_modules"</em> which inside will contain all of this project's dependencies.</p>
<p>Whilst that is downloading and installing (<em>usually a few minutes</em>) you can <strong>edit the options.json</strong> file in the root folder. There are comments in this hat should help you to but for more advanced configuration check out the options.json wiki page.</p>
<p>Once the installation has completed, ensure all the software is correctly installed by typing :</p>
<p><code>gulp</code></p>
<p>Which should bring up a little help message with all of the available commands and options.</p>
<p><em>If you cannot see this</em>, try doing a <strong>fresh clone of this repo</strong> and retrying the installation steps.</p>
<p>Also, you may find an answer to your problems in the <strong>FAQ</strong> in the <a href="https://github.com/designerzen/Animated-HTML5-Banner-Advert-Boilerplate/wiki">Wiki</a>.</p>
