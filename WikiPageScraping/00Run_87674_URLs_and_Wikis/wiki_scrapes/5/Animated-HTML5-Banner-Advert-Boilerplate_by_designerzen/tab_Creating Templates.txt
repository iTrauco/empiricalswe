          <p>Once you have edited your <em>options.json</em>, you should really start here, with the built in template system.</p>
<p>Templates are simple text files that can be edited that create your html ( and manifest.js files ) in an automated and rapid fashion.</p>
<p>You do not have to edit them at all but by changing them, this will allow you to quickly generate many html files from one single template, or from a range of templates if you so wish. As most banner ads contain similar content, but span different sizes or languages, this can be a real time-saver.</p>
<p>###To Create templates###</p>
<p>Firstly <em>ensure that you have editted the options.json</em> with your appropriate settings.
Pay close attention to types (remove any that don't apply) and variants...
And add as many variants as you wish (these are the duplicate templates named accordingly)</p>
<p>Types are the required sizes for the campaign. You can use any of the following :</p>
<p>##Generic##</p>
<pre><code>"banner", 
"halfBanner", 
"halfPage", 
"leaderboard", 
"mpu", 
"skyscraper", 
"verticalBanner", 
"wideSkyscraper
</code></pre>
<p>##Mobiles##</p>
<pre><code>"mobileBanner",
"mobileMpu",
"mobileLeaderboard",
</code></pre>
<p>##Expandables##</p>
<pre><code>"expandableLeaderboard",
"expandableMpu",
"expandableSkyscraper",
"expandableWideSkyscraper",
"expandableHalfPage",
"expandableBanner",
"expandableVerticalBanner",
"expandableHalfBanner",
"expandableBanner",
"expandableMpu",
"expandableLeaderboard"
</code></pre>
<p>Variants can be anything you want</p>
<p>Languages are for multi-language ads and helps create a maintainable workflow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>eg. 'en', 'th', 'hk', 'de'</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you have common elements on all of your pages, you can edit the <strong>template.jade partial</strong> as these will be cloned into your templates.</p>
<p>You can use the shortcut <strong>#{type}</strong> wherever you want to have type specific elements (mpu/skyscraper/banner etc).
The shortcuts <strong>#{width}</strong> and <strong>#{height}</strong> are also available if you wish to use them!</p>
<p>Then in command prompt run</p>
<blockquote>
<p>gulp scaffold</p>
</blockquote>
<p>to create both jade template files for adding in your content, and a project manifest for each size.</p>
<p>This creates a series of Jade files that just require personalisation of content - ready for adding in your text, images and animated elements.</p>
<p><em>NB. if you just want jade (templates) or javascript manifests</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>gulp templates</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>gulp manifest</p>
</blockquote>
