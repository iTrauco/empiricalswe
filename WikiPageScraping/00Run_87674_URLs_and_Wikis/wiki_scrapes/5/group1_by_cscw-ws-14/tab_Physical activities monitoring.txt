          <p>##Abstract</p>
<p>Health focused technologies are getting a bit of traction this recent year. The ubiquitous and internet of things that are also contribute to this trend have had companies produce sensors that can be used to produce body’s external and internal measurement.</p>
<p>Our daily working habits and conditions can trigger many health issues built up over time. Japanese government has issued fine to companies that have overweight staffs on their employment. That is why some companies in Japan have specified some schedule to have their staff do exercises.</p>
<p>Fraunhofer is an Institute which cares about their staffs’ health can implement smart offices that encourage their staff to some non mandatory physical activities to improve or preserve their health condition. The smart office can detect activities inside the employees’ work space, and can recommend health related actions for the workers to do.</p>
<p>To increase this program participation, we are proposing a Gamification process. it is a process that can introduce rivalry between employees thus increasing the participation of this program.</p>
<p>By improving staffs’ health, Fraunhofer can gain improvement on many aspects such as less sick leaves, thus improving productivity of its workforce.</p>
<p>##Our Program at a glance</p>
<p>By placing motion sensor and webcams in the workspace, we can detect that this employee has no other physical activities during works than sitting, and thus recommending this person to do some physical actions such as stretching, or jumping jacks, drinks water or even breathing properly. By properly doing this activities, we can then put some scores based on some rules, and then rank the participant on some leaderboards.</p>
<p>Based on these aims, we will have a few components that can interact to each other, which are:
Aggregator of sensors data and the business logic
Smart phone application
Recommendation of activities
Leaderboards
User profile
Server application for gamification and scoring rules, including leaderboards
Server application for user profile and behaviour analysis to recommending activities
Below we will explain each components in more detail.
###Aggregator of sensors data and the detection algorithm</p>
<p>This aggregator will read data that is being published by sensors and based on these data, it will have an algorithm that can detect an employee physical activities. this component will push this result to the gamification, and recommendation servers.
###Client notification application</p>
<p>the client will be notified for events that are triggered by the sensors. the events are pushed by the server and then it will act accordingly.
####Recommendation of activities
In the client app, there will be built in some tutorial or pointer of activities that can be shown to the employee according to the activity that is recommended by the server. when it gets the notification, it will ask the employee to do this particular activity, and then asks for confirmation to the employee once he/she has done it.
####Leaderboards
Client can see the other staffs’ scores sorted by the highest score of the week.
####User profile
Client can see the activities that have been recommended for the day, whether he/she has done it or not, and also the scores for today and the week.</p>
<p>###Server application for gamification, scoring rules, and leaderboards</p>
<p>The server will get inputs from the client and taking into account the user profile data, it will apply the score calculation based on the rules. it then records and calculate the leaderboards standing.</p>
<p>###Server application for user profile and behaviour analysis to recommending activities</p>
<p>The server will get inputs from the sensors. taking into accounts the user profile data, such as their movements records, it will calculate the recommended activities.</p>
