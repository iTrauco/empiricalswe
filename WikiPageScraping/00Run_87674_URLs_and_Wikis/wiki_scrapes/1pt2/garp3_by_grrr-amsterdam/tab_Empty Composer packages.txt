          <p>If you find composer packages missing on the server, make sure they're not installed as submodules or subtrees or what have you.</p>
<p>They're a gnarly pain in the ass and since we can't guarantee the availability of <code>composer</code> on the web server, it's just not for us.</p>
<p>You can install Composer packages with the <code>--prefer-dist</code> flag to get a copy in your repo.</p>
<pre><code>composer update --prefer-dist
</code></pre>
<p>That should do it.</p>
