          <p>PartTest is for testing parts (or just activating them, for staged parts).  This parameter supports child parameters - you will only be able to complete the part test if all child parameters are also completed.</p>
<p>Typically, this is used in tandem with the <a class="internal present" href="/jrossignol/ContractConfigurator/wiki/ExperimentalPart-Behaviour">ExperimentalPart Behaviour</a> to unlock a part as experimental so that it can be tested.</p>
<p>Also, for a part to work with PartTest, the part needs to have a <code>ModuleTestSubject</code> in the part configuration.  There are two relevant fields, <code>useStaging</code> (which indicates the test is done through staging), and <code>useEvent</code> (which gives a Run Test option).  The other fields are used by the stock PartTest contract.</p>
<p>It is possible to add <code>ModuleTestSubject</code> to parts that don't already have it using Module Manager.</p>
