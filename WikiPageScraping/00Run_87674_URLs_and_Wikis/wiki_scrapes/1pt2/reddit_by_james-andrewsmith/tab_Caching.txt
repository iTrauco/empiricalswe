          <p>The first rule of the reddit API is to respect that most pages only refresh every 30 seconds, with that in mind this library is automatically configured to cache all subreddit post listing requests for 30 seconds. This is done by creating a hash of the URL requested and keeping the response in memory, any requests made over the next 30 seconds will get the locally cached result.</p>
<p>This can be overridden in certain use cases (eg: if the application you are writing exists in a distributed environment), but be careful we don't want to break the blue alien.</p>
