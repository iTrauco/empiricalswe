          <p>It is arguable that tennis is the greatest game ever played. Not only is it challenging physically, but it is also emotionally and mentally challenging. Overcoming these challenges is what makes the game lastingly entertaining.</p>
<p>There is one downfall to the sport, however. That is, finding new opponents to play. You may have your close buddies to call up and play, but some of the times, they aren't able or willing to play. On top of that, if you are serious about improving your skills, you will need new opponents who have different playing styles. The more variety you have from your opponents, the more adaptable you will become.</p>
<p>Pickup-Tennis helps you overcome this downfall by opening you up to a network of tennis players. By finding others near you with a similar skill level, you will never run out of new opponents. In addition, the app is free! All you need to do is create an account, specify your playing level, and voila! A list of local players near you is at your finger tips. You can now invite others to play, start up a tournament, and build up your account's point system by continually improving your skills and winning your opponents.</p>
<p>This app, upon its completion, will support the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create an account with information such as name, contact info (email, phone-optional), home court location, right handed/left handed, skill level (beginner, intermediate, professional, etc.) or tennis rating, and age</li>
<li>Ability for users to view a list of suggestions for who to play based on skill level and location of other users</li>
<li>Ability for users to invite someone to play</li>
<li>Ability for users to set time and location on siteâ€™s feed of when and where they are able to play</li>
<li>Ability for users to report a win or loss against an opponent</li>
<li>History of users' wins/losses and schedule of future dates</li>
<li>Ability for users to have conversations with each other privily</li>
<li>Ability for user to start a tournament and invite other users to play</li>
<li>Point system for each user (receive points for wins, playing multiple weeks in a row, accomplishing missions/goals, etc. and losing points for losses)</li>
<li>Emailer for notifications and reminders</li>
</ul>
<p>For the CS 360 assignment, I intend on finishing the first six features. This app will use a Ruby on Rails framework with Unicorn as the application server, Nginx as the web server, PostgreSQL as the database, and AngularJS, CoffeeScript, and SCSS for front-end technologies.</p>
