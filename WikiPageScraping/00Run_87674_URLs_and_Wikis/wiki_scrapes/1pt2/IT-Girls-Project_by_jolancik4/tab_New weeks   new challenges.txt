          <p>Hi guys, very busy on the project, so little time to write about everything. But for all of you working on their projects, you know what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>The work has gone a lot further since I last wrote. The page looks more and more amazing (in regards of it's functionality, because there is still some work on the layout). Just last week I was working on different views for customers that are logged in and not logged in. Now I focus my attention to such things as different kinds of users (admin and customer) and different options for each of them.</p>
<p>Jana is helpful and patient as always, that's why our work on this project is a lot of fun and learning!</p>
<p>So to all of you out there: Learn IT Girl and keep coding :)</p>
