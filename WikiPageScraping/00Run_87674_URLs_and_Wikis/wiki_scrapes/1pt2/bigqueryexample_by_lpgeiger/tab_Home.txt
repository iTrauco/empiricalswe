          <p>In Googles Big Query Language, there are "Datasets" and "Tables", living within one "Project"</p>
<p>Assume for this prototype: there is one company only, one user, and just importing valid xlxs files.</p>
<p>In Big Query:</p>
<ul>
<li>Warehouse "Dataset": There are "Tables" of imported xxlx files.  These are flagged by import_date.</li>
</ul>
<p>In Appengine DB Datastore:</p>
<ul>
<li>App DB: This persists the app data. For now it will only persist  user's selection what BigQuery Table column refers to: [ measure , dimension , Date ]</li>
</ul>
