          <p>A new version of Sumatra has been released, you <code>Help -&gt; Check for updates</code> menu and it didn't notify about a new release. Is this a bug?</p>
<p>Most likely not.</p>
<p>We wait at least a week before activating update check. That way, if there is a major problem with a new release that we didn't catch in testing, less people will have to re-download the update that fixes the problem.</p>
