"Similar to acrobat these are called “named” destinations,

<p>you will find that option along with others under the heading "Navigation options"
on the folowing page <a href="https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/docs/Command-line-arguments.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/docs/Command-line-arguments.html</a>
so for your example it would be
</p>
<p>“SumatraPdf.exe” -named-dest “My Bookmark” “test.pdf”
</p>
<p>beware you MAY need all the quote marks as shown for filepath / strings wih spaces
</p>
<p>note the bookmark MUST usually :slight_smile: be a full bookmark entry including spaces as shown, however there are a few cases where that may not apply, just to trip you up :slight_smile:
</p>
<p>ALSO note that the results may NOT always be what you expect, often the page expected is shown but the highlighted entry may not be the one you entered, this is quite common due to overlapping or mis-sychronised / nested Bookmarks, it is better to use the -page ( and -scroll) option rather than bookmarks unless they are very well formed and tested"
