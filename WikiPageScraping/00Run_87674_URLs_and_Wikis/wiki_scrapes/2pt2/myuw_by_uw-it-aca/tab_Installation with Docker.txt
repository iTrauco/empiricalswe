          <p>First, install Docker:</p>
<p><a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/" rel="nofollow">Windows</a>, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/" rel="nofollow">Mac</a>, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/" rel="nofollow">Ubuntu</a>, <a href="https://docs.docker.com/install/" rel="nofollow">Other</a></p>
<p>If you're on a Mac, you will need to run Docker.</p>
<p>If you're using Ubuntu, you'll need to be root.</p>
<p>If you're reinstalling with the same directory that previously had a docker build, you'll need to delete your project/ folder. Be sure to <code>git stash</code> any changes that you want to keep ahead of time that aren't committed.</p>
<p>Navigate to the directory that you want your MyUW installation to reside within in terminal and run the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/uw-it-aca/myuw
cd myuw
git checkout docker
docker build -t myuw_web:latest . &amp;&amp; id=$(docker create myuw_web) &amp;&amp; docker cp $id:/app/project/ . &amp;&amp; docker rm -v $id &amp;&amp; docker-compose up
</code></pre>
<p>TODO:</p>
<p>Get a windows commandline equivalent of the bash script working.</p>
<p>Determine what to do with an existing project/ folder (rename old files? delete old files?).</p>
<p>Add a postgres database, memcached instance and multi-node app hosts and investigate performance hit.</p>
