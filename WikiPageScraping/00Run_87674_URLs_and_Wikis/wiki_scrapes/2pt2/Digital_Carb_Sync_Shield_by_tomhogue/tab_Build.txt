<p>Carb Sync V2 build instructions</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Make sure you have all the parts and all the sensors you are going to use.
The sensors have a notch in one corner. The board has a white dot near a
corner of every pad. These align.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If building with fewer than 6 sensors use the two sensor locations on the
left (1 &amp; 4), then the two in the center (2 &amp; 5). This aligns
screen data and the sensors. Any other alignment requires custom software
adjustments. For reference, the board is marked and the LCD is at the
bottom.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If using solder paste and either a hot plate or toaster oven put a dollop
of paste on each pad, position sensors, heat carefully, then let cool. It
is easy if you buy a small quantity of paste in a syringe dispenser. It is
also easy to work with a small tub of paste and a small applicator. YouTube
has solder paste videos – check them out. You don't need a solder mask.
It is highly recommended to use one of the solder paste methods on the
sensors if you are new to soldering or don't have a decent soldering
iron.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If using a soldering iron work carefully. YouTube has soldering videos –
check them out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do not proceed until you have the sensors mounted correctly with a quality
solder job. Use a decent soldering iron not a toy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mount and solder the LCD dimmer potentiometer, the reset switch and the
resistor. The pot and the reset only fit the board correctly. The resistor
does not have a required polarity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The board uses an optional header and jumper to set the board sensor
operating voltage. This is only needed to match the voltage to the sensors
being used. The board does not use IOREF so that a wider combination of
Arduinos and sensors can be supported. In most cases sensors will run on
5v. Solder a solid wire from the small center hole to the small hole on the
5v side or install the header and jumper.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The easiest way to solder the male pin headers for the Arduino mount is to
place all four onto the Arduino board. Fit the Carb Sync Shield board on
top. This will hold everything in alignment. Then solder the header pins.
If using breakaway headers size them correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The 3 small digital I/O headers locations are optional. If your kit has
them it is recommended to leave them off. They connect to digital pins 2,3
and 5, ground and power. The middle one – J2 – is currently reserved for
future use as the RPM sensor connector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are many ways to connect the LCD display. The standard way is to
solder a 16 pin male header up into the LCD. Take care to get it straight.
Then push the long pins down through the shield board holes and solder.
Take care to get it straight. This is a solid mount. You can use different
16 pin connectors to mount the LCD as desired. It can be removable, or
right angle connected, or below the shield board level with the Arduino.
Take care to get it straight.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Most problems will be caused by failed solder joints at the sensors or LCD.
Especially the LCD. Take care to do it right the first time. Be very
certain the sensors are aligned correctly before soldering. Make sure the
LCD is straight – use a jig or supports.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remember when you power it up the first time the potentiometer is a dimmer
switch that you'll have to adjust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If something goes wrong most solder joints can be reworked. If something
goes really wrong carefully de-solder the component to reposition. YouTube
has lots of useful videos.</p>
