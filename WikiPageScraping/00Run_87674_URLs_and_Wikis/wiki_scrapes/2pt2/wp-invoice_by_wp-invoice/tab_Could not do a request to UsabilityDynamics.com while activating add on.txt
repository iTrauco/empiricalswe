          <p>When receiving an error: <strong>"There was an error making activation request. Could not do a request to UsabilityDynamics.com"</strong> when trying to activate a plug-in, please contact your host provider and ask them to let the requests be done for UsabilityDynamics site. They should support  <code>SSL V3</code>.</p>
<p>If server does not have support for <code>SSL V3</code>, evident via this error:</p>
<p><code>:SSL routines:SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:sslv3 alert handshake failure</code></p>
<p>then the workaround is to override the API URL like so to your wp-config.php file:</p>
<p>Put this code somewhere in the beginning, before the code that includes wp-settings.php, which is usually at the bottom.</p>
<p><code>if( !defined( 'UD_API_URL' ) ) { define( 'UD_API_URL', 'http://api.usabilitydynamics.com/' );}</code></p>
<p>That should fix the issue by making the requests NOT use https.</p>
