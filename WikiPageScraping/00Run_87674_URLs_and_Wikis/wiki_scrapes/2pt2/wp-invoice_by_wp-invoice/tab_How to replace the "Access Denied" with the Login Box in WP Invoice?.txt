          <p>To use the Dashboard / My Account</p>
<p><strong>Step 1)</strong> Enable My Account</p>
<p><strong>Step 2)</strong> Select Unified Template for Invoice Display</p>
<p><strong>Step 3)</strong> Important: If you wish to modify the design - enable the local
theme checkbox
Important: Unless you are using a custom theme, be sure to use a child
theme as otherwise these changes will be lost upon upgrade of theme</p>
<p><em>Suggestion - You may want to have these files in <code>wp-content/uploads/wpi</code>
instead as then it becomes independent of the theme &amp; plugin and is update
safe</em></p>
<p><strong>Step 4)</strong> I modified Dashboard to replace the Access Denied with the
WordPress Login Box</p>
<p><strong>Step 5)</strong> You can use Peter's Login Redirect so that after login it will auto
redirect back to the dashboard</p>
<p><strong>Step 6)</strong> Using Styles I have hidden the "total" as people may not realize
that is the total amount invoiced, not the total amount due</p>
<p><strong>Step 7)</strong> Replaced Return to Website with Logout (with Permalink) to take you
back to the dashboard login</p>
