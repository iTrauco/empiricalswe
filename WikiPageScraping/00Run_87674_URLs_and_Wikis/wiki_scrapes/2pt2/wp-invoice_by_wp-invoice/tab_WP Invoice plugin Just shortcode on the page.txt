          <p>[wp-invoice] shortcode shouldn't show any invoice by itself. It only shows the place on the page where should be your invoice and only if you have this option enabled.Â </p>

<p>So if you included shortcode [wp-invoice] in the content of the page, users will see just shortcode, not invoice on this page, so be sure users do not have direct link to this page.</p>
<p>When you will send particular invoice to someone from your site, they will see their invoice page you set up.</p>
<p>You can use another method how to insert invoice to the page so you won't need shortcode at all.</p>
