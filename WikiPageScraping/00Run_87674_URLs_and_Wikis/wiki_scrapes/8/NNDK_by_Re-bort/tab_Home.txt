<p>The Neural Network Development Kit (NNDK) is a C++ library that implements a range of supervised and unsupervised artificial neural network classes, training algorithms; and auxiliary classes that implement algorithms for data splitting and variable selection.</p>
<p>The Neural Network Development Kit was developed as part of research undertaken by the School of Civil, Environmental and Mining Engineering at the University of Adelaide, with a goal to develop best-practices for the application of neural networks to water resources and environmental modelling applications.</p>
<p>The aim was to develop a class library to implement fundamental ANN structures and learning algorithms, which could be used to rapidly develop and evaluate new model development procedures.</p>
<p>An Excel add-in that provides a GUI for a pre-compiled set of tools for the development of ANN models for time-series forecasting and non-linear regression applications, was implemented using on the NNDK.</p>
