          <p>The cultural panels show the progression and distribution of cultures as the simulation advances. There are four panels in total, one representing the agents' belief space. The other three represent institutional spaces. The <em>Institutions including homophily Axelrod (1997) - Ulloa(2016)</em> model (See <a href="https://github.com/robertour/cultural-simulations/wiki/B.-Initial-Parameters">B. Initial Parameters</a>) is the only model that includes institutions, and therefore the only model available that uses all four panels. The other three models only reflect in the upper left Cultural Space panel.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Cultural Space (top-left)</strong>: Each agent is represented in its corresponding location in the World (grid). The color of the agent reflects its cultural vector, picked according to the trait values. The default number of features is 6, and the number of traits is 15, plus 1 foreigner trait (See <a href="https://github.com/robertour/CulSim/wiki/B.-Initial-Parameters">B. Initial Parameters</a>). They have been selected in order to use the maximum spectrum of computer screen colors (i.e. 6 hexadecimal values), higher values might make interpretation of the panels difficult due to repeated colors. In general, the cultural space provides an idea of the simulation state. A more reliable way to supervise the progress of the simulation are the graph panels (See <a href="https://github.com/robertour/CulSim/wiki/F.-Response-variables">Response Variables</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Corresponding Institutional Cultural Space (top-right)</strong>: Each agent belongs to an institution, and this institution also has a cultural vector. Therefore, an interesting way to represent the relationship between an agent and its institution is by showing the corresponding color of the institutional cultural vector, along with the agent's. Each agent is represented in its corresponding location in the World (grid), but the institutional cultural space shows the color of the institution's cultural vector to which the agent belongs to.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Institutions</strong>: This panel shows every institution's "location" as an average position of all the agents that belong to it, i.e. the "center". Internally, institutions don't have a pre-defined "location". Additionally, each location dot is also denoted by the color associated with the institutional cultural vector.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Existent Institutions</strong>: This panel shows only the location of the existent institutions, and changes the color to white. This panel is a visualization help to spot institutions that have been assigned a darker color that might be hard to see on the black background of the panel. The Existent Institutions panel makes it easier to detect those institutions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There is also a <strong>Output text panel</strong> below the cultural panels. This panel (shown below) reports important occurrences in the simulation, e.g. initializations, errors, final states, etc.</p>
