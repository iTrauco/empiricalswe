          <p>Welcome to the essay-scoring-spring wiki!</p>
<p>Changes to prior version:</p>
<ul>
<li>Math equation solver improvements (a parser that automatically cleans and evaluates mathematical expressions).</li>
<li>Adding word2vec word embeddings in an other way than before by creating clusters of similar words - it gave good improvements on some essays.</li>
<li>Using the newest implementation of a tree boosting which is really fast and better than the previous implementation (xgboost)</li>
<li>Added some very strong features based on n-gram coverage vs wikipedia. For example - how many 3-grams in the essay are occuring in the wikipedia texts. By including it the model has some stylistic insights which is really impossible to get using essays' texts. A low coverage of the text almost always means that something is wrong with the essay itself</li>
</ul>
