<p>Writing a document like this is difficult because it becomes very difficult to
not to compare your work to other systems and in turn to sound like you are
slagging them off, like you've got nothing wrong yourself. As such, I'm going
to try to keep the comparisons as concise as possible.</p>
<p>Writing applications is difficult. The reason we turn to frameworks is to make
our lives easier by allowing us to focus on the task at hand while it abstracts
away the difficulty. The frameworks in turn have a number of factors to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do their authors/users find more comfort in Domain Specific Language approaches
or in the more traditional Monolithic MVC better suited for them</li>
<li>Are they focused around rigid policies such as SOLID, or are they more pragmatic</li>
<li>Are they targeting the enterprise or the enthusiast</li>
</ul>
<p>In hunting the correct solution and trying to answer to the constraints of the
project, or sometimes by sheer ignorance, performance suffers. This is where
it gets tricky: <strong>performance suffers</strong>. What does that mean?</p>
<p>It is subjective. To me it means that the framework adds on overhead which gets
passed onto the end user without some kind of mitigation beyond environmental
changes. I've seen, on Twitter and in blogs, suggestions that if you want
performance that you have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't use a framework (pure PHP is waaaay cooler, bro)</li>
<li>You need to get a load balanced EC2 infrastructure with high availability
database servers and PHP-FPM with OPCache, or why not switch to HHVM?</li>
</ul>
<p>These basically push the problem onto the application engineer rather than
being dealt with by the frameworks themselves by optimising their processes.
In a number of cases the problem of performance is simply baked into the
design and the problems cannot be refactored out because of API stability
concerns.</p>
<p>This project is getting consistently low response times when compared to
pure PHP equivalents (in my test app, 0.002 seconds per request) while
not putting too many constraints upon developers; and this is the overall
guiding principle of development on this project.</p>
<p>A basic assumption is also made about the end users environment:</p>
<ul>
<li>Shared hosting environment</li>
<li>PHP5.3</li>
<li>No OPCaching</li>
</ul>
<p>If we can get good performance under these kinds of conditions then we can
get even better when we have high performance environments.</p>

<p>There are three major things to consider when looking at performance:</p>
<ul>
<li>The amount of objects involved</li>
<li>The amount of method calls involved</li>
<li>The amount of files involved</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It's important to note that this does not apply to every situation, and that
these ideas have come out of testing and the constraints of the framework
itself. Obviously some of these ideas are just good rules of thumb.</p>

<p>The amount of objects is fairly simple. Anything loaded that is not directly
used in serving the request is a waste of time, and anything duplicated is
also a waste. During the lifecycle of the application there are 9 classes loaded
and 8 objects, at the maximum there are 10 objects in memory owned by the
framework. This keeps things nice and tight.</p>

<a aria-hidden="true" class="anchor" href="#method-calls" id="user-content-method-calls"><svg aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link" height="16" version="1.1" viewBox="0 0 16 16" width="16"><path d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z" fill-rule="evenodd"></path></svg></a>Method Calls</h3>
<p>Every time PHP has to jump the callstack, we are penalised. It doesn't amount
to much in and of itself but overall this does has an effect on the performance.
That said we cannot write an application without them, so instead we need to
break the problem down to simple need: if we get a performance benefit for
not doing the call we'll find a way not too.</p>
<p>A good example of this is the way the <code>Router</code> uses the <code>Cache</code>. It started life
as:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-text-html-php"><pre><span class="pl-s1"></span>
<span class="pl-s1">    <span class="pl-k">public</span> <span class="pl-k">function</span> <span class="pl-en">getTable</span>()</span>
<span class="pl-s1">    {</span>
<span class="pl-s1">        <span class="pl-k">if</span> (<span class="pl-smi">$this</span><span class="pl-k">-&gt;</span><span class="pl-smi">cache</span><span class="pl-k">-&gt;</span>has(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>router<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>)) {</span>
<span class="pl-s1">            <span class="pl-k">return</span> <span class="pl-smi">$this</span><span class="pl-k">-&gt;</span><span class="pl-smi">cache</span><span class="pl-k">-&gt;</span>get(<span class="pl-s"><span class="pl-pds">"</span>router<span class="pl-pds">"</span></span>);</span>
<span class="pl-s1">        }</span>
<span class="pl-s1">        </span>
<span class="pl-s1">        <span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">//</span> ...</span></span>
<span class="pl-s1">    }</span>
<span class="pl-s1"></span></pre></div>
<p>This is quite a common idea, it can be seen in lots of framework code, but it
is also slow because of the amount of duplicate work being done:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-text-html-php"><pre><span class="pl-s1"></span>
<span class="pl-s1">    <span class="pl-k">public</span> <span class="pl-k">function</span> <span class="pl-en">has</span>(<span class="pl-smi">$key</span>)</span>
<span class="pl-s1">    {</span>
<span class="pl-s1">        <span class="pl-k">return</span> <span class="pl-c1">isset</span>(<span class="pl-smi">$this</span><span class="pl-k">-&gt;</span><span class="pl-smi">state</span>[<span class="pl-smi">$key</span>]);</span>
<span class="pl-s1">    }</span>
<span class="pl-s1"></span>
<span class="pl-s1">    <span class="pl-k">public</span> <span class="pl-k">function</span> <span class="pl-en">get</span>(<span class="pl-smi">$key</span>)</span>
<span class="pl-s1">    {</span>
<span class="pl-s1">        <span class="pl-k">if</span> (<span class="pl-smi">$this</span><span class="pl-k">-&gt;</span>has(<span class="pl-smi">$key</span>)) {</span>
<span class="pl-s1">            <span class="pl-k">return</span> <span class="pl-smi">$this</span><span class="pl-k">-&gt;</span><span class="pl-smi">state</span>[<span class="pl-smi">$key</span>];</span>
<span class="pl-s1">        }</span>
<span class="pl-s1">        </span>
<span class="pl-s1">        <span class="pl-k">return</span> <span class="pl-c1">null</span>;</span>
<span class="pl-s1">    }</span>
<span class="pl-s1"></span></pre></div>
<p>Another point of sloppiness here is that there is no difference between checking
a null or an array for truthiness, so the fact that we are checking for bools makes
no sense. An XDebug Profile discovered this waste and after some refactoring
the implementation became:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-text-html-php"><pre><span class="pl-s1"></span>
<span class="pl-s1">    <span class="pl-k">public</span> <span class="pl-k">function</span> <span class="pl-en">getTable</span>()</span>

<span class="pl-s1">        }</span>

<p>This small change saved about 1% off of the request time. Anywhere we can make
these kinds of changes - especially considering that very little of the internals
are exposed to the end user - we should. My goal is to make this codebase as lean
as possible.</p>

<p>Autoloading is great but by and large slow, even with OPCaching. As such we
have to offer the ability to compile the files that are needed for every
request to allow for best performance. There is <code>classpreloader</code> which
does this already but it has a lot of dependencies which are superfluous
when the script is fairly lightweight.</p>
<p>But it's something to bear in mind, and it's a challenge to the SOLID
approach- sometimes it makes more sense to put functionality in an
existing place.</p>

<p>Lastly, but importantly:</p>
<ul>
<li>If we can avoid iterating over a set (especially a set of dynamic content)
then we should. In the context of the framework, it's costly.</li>
<li>If you can avoid jumping to userland code, more the better. The <code>Services</code>
object is a good example of one method for doing this.</li>
</ul>

<p>One of the benefits of Composer is that is allows us to easily share code.
One of the downsides is that those dependencies do not always share goals
of the project and so cannot be used. For example, <code>symfony/http-foundation</code>
was used prior to the creation of the HTTP layer but proved to be a real
weight to the framework; they have their own stuff and they have lots of
BC rules, maybe could be patched but probably not. Additionally, foundation
loads 9 classes if you just want 2, more than the size of the framework
at the time.</p>
<p>The only other option that made sense was the layer found in <code>slim/slim</code>.
It has a reputation for being pretty good, but wasn't standalone and so
has been forked for the purposes of this project. It keeps the project
dependency free, performant and has a solid base.</p>
