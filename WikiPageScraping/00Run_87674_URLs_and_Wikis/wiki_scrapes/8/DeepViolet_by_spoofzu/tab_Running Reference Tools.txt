          <p><strong>INSTALLATION &amp; USE INSTRUCTIONS</strong>, 1) <a href="https://github.com/spoofzu/DeepViolet/releases">DOWNLOAD BINARIES</a> or compile source, 2) make sure Java 8+ installed, 3) download dvUI.jar to your desktop from the Release tab near the top of the screen, double-click to run.</p>
<p><strong>CAUTION</strong>, use care to review reports for sensitive information prior to distribution or posting to the Internet</p>
<p><strong>RUNNING FROM DESKTOP</strong>, simply double-click on the dvGUI.jar on your desktop or launch the desktop application from the command line.  Note: there are no command line options when staring the DeepViolet GUI from the command line.<br/>
<code>java -jar dvUI.jar</code>

<p><strong>RUNNING FROM COMMAND LINE</strong>, The following command line executes a scan against <a href="http://www.github.com">www.github.com</a> and includes all reporting sections.  The output of the report is the same as the sample included in this file.<br/>
<code>java -jar dvCMD.jar -serverurl <a href="https://www.github.com/">https://www.github.com/</a></code></p>
<p>The following command line produces the same report but specifies each report section individually.  Including less sections increases the speed of the scan.<br/>
<code>java -jar dvCMD.jar -serverurl <a href="https://www.github.com/">https://www.github.com/</a> -s thrcisn</code></p>
<p>The following command line exports the certificate on <a href="http://www.github.com">www.github.com</a> to a PEM encoded file for offline use.
<code>java -jar dvCMD.jar -serverurl <a href="https://www.github.com/">https://www.github.com/</a> -wc ~/milton/DeepViolet/github.pem</code><br/></p>
<p>Conversely the following command line reads a PEM encoded certificate and generates a report ('s' option) by default.  Note: the -rc option is mututually exclusive with other options.  The primary reason is that -rc is an offline reporting function.  Whereas other options are applicable for online servers.<br/>
<code>java -jar dvCMD.jar -rc ~/milton/DeepViolet/github.pem</code></p>
<p>If you need some help while your in the shell, command line help is available.<br/>
<code> java -jar dvCMD.jar -h</code></p>
<p>The previous help command produces output like the following.<br/>
