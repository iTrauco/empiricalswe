          <p>Welcome to the windows-phone-winjs-datepicker wiki!</p>
<p>This project is my attempt to build a better looking WinJS DatePicker for Windows Phone. I'll be very simple to use and will work just as a regular WinJS control.</p>
<p>In this wiki I expect to document everything needed to get it working on a brand new project.</p>
<p>Also, there's a <a href="https://github.com/sebagomez/windows-phone-winjs-datepicker/tree/master/sample">test/sample</a> project where you can see it running.</p>
<p>Here's a real simple <a href="https://github.com/sebagomez/windows-phone-winjs-datepicker/wiki/Getting-started">getting started</a> page with what I believe it's everything you need to use the control.</p>
<p>Feel free to fork and send pull requests.</p>
