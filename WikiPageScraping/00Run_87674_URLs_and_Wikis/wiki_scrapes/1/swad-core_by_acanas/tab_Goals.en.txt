<p>The objectives addressed in the development of the platform SWAD can be specified depending on its potential beneficiaries:</p>
<ul>
<li>For teachers and other administrators of the platform, the objectives were carrying through internet the management tasks related to a course and its students, and improved mentoring and general communication with them.</li>
<li>For students, the objectives have been improved access to materials and information of the courses, the possibility of self-assessment at a distance, and the improvement of the communication both student-student and student-teacher.</li>
</ul>
<p>A fundamental criterion at the development of the platform has been to facilitate its use by users, emphasizing both the ease of learning and use for students and teachers (usability), and the time saving and quality improvement in various tasks related to teaching.</p>
<p>For the institution or company, SWAD has the additional advantage of being fast and efficient, consuming <a href="https://swad.ugr.es/server/" rel="nofollow">very little computer resources</a>, so being suitable for low-cost installations. Compared to other tools used for the same purpose, since its <a href="https://openswad.org/source/" rel="nofollow">implementation in C language</a>, SWAD does not require a big hardware and software infrastructure, even in large universities, being sufficient <a href="https://swad.ugr.es/server/" rel="nofollow">a single server</a>.</p>
