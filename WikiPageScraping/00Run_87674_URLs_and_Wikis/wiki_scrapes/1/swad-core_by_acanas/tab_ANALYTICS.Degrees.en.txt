<p>The <strong>ANALYTICS &gt; Degrees</strong> option displays information on the number of users in each of the platform <a href="CENTRE.Degrees.en">degrees</a>. Instead of representing the number of users of each degree with a bar graph, it is shown by an average photograph of all faces of the students of the degree, whose size (area) will be proportional to the number of students.</p>
<p>First, a <strong>link to update the average picture of the students of one degree</strong> is shown, followed by a drop down menu to choose the degree to be updated. In each menu option, the name of the degree and the estimated time that will be used to calculate the average photograph are displayed. The estimated time is actually the time used in the calculation of the average photograph the last time it was calculated for that degree, and is normally proportional to the number of students with photography in that degree. By default, the least recently updated degree is selected, but you can select other degree to be updated. The average photograph of each degree is computed by two modules external to SWAD core: <a href="https://github.com/dcalandria/foto_promedio">foto_mediana and foto_promedio</a>, programmed by <a href="https://es.linkedin.com/in/dcalandria" rel="nofollow">Daniel Jesús Calandria Hernández</a>. When the photography of a degree is updated, this degree will be temporarily disabled in the drop-down menu. If all the photos are up to date, the link and the drop-down menu will not appear for a while.</p>
<p>Second, three drop-down menus are displayed, in which you can <strong>select several options</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Average type
<ul>
<li>median of all the photos (default)</li>
<li>arithmetic mean of all the photos</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Size of photos
<ul>
<li>proportional to the number of students (default)</li>
<li>proportional to the number of students with photo</li>
<li>proportional to the percentage of students with photo</li>
<li>same for all degrees</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sort degrees by:
<ul>
<li>number of students (default)</li>
<li>number of students with photo</li>
<li>percentage of students with photo</li>
<li>degree name</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, the <strong>list of average photographs of the degrees</strong> is displayed, where you can choose the format of presentation, just as it is done with the <a href="USERS.Students.en#list-of-students">list of students</a>, between:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Photo of class</p>
<ul>
<li>With selectable number of columns</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>List</p>
<ul>
<li>With photos</li>
<li>Without photos</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case the students are disaggregated by sex, in the following columns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Unknown</li>
<li>Women</li>
<li>Men</li>
<li>All</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
