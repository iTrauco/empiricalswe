<p>Rather than create a ticket for every little thing we think of, let's keep a running list of UI notes here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Test down to 1024 width screens (map overlaps table on small screens). Or do we want to support down to Ipad/Mobile size? Separate CSS for different devices?</li>
<li>We should probably remove all the property polygons from the DOM when in stand edit mode.</li>
<li>We need better error handling/reporting right now any errors just cause the app to go into a broken state</li>
<li>refreshing takes you back to initial view, hash urls?</li>
<li>Initial view should not say "no stands under mgmt" unless it actually gets a response from the server which indicates that. A better message might be some sort of "Please wait while we look up your stand information..."</li>
<li>related: Loading stands has a lag but no 'waiting' message (one might think they lost their stands).</li>
<li>We need some sort of message/notification system that handles errors.</li>
<li>Breadcrumbs</li>
<li>signin and register div id's duplicated on initial screen</li>
<li>extra closing div?</li>
<li>Flot.js ?</li>
<li>When in manage stands, need indication about which property is active</li>
<li>Need way to "Zoom to Extent" of property within stand mgmt view</li>
</ul>
