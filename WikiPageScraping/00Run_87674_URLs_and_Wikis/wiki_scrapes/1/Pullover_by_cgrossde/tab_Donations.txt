          <p><strong>Update:</strong> I stopped collecting for a code signing certificate. The previous provider Certum increased the fees (89€) and at the moment I don't have the time or donations to go through the process of acquiring a new one.</p>
<p>I added a donation button to the README because I would like to code sign Pullover. I will list all donations here and buy a code signing certificate (Windows: 17.22€/year) and Apple Developer Membership (99$/year) once enough money was donated.</p>
<p>If you like to donate for a specific platform (win / OS X) just mention it with the donation.
If you want a name or alias listed with your donation, also mention that with the donation. Otherwise your donation will be anonymous.</p>
<p>Thank you for donating.</p>
<p><strong>Total</strong>: 32.00 €<br/>
<strong>Total after Paypal fees</strong>: 29.94 €<br/>
<strong>Cost Windows CSC</strong>: 17.22 €<br/>
<strong>Money remaining</strong>: 12.72 €<br/>
