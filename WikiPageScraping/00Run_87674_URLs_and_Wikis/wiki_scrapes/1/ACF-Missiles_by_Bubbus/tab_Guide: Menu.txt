<p>This guide will cover the different options and ammunition-related variables that will affect your missiles. As you'd expect, different kinds of missiles behave differently, based on their purpose (ASM, AAM, SAM), and their components (fuse, guidance, propellant, munitions type, etc).</p>
<p>First of all, you need to know what type of missile you're looking for. If you're building an aircraft that should be able to shoot down other aircraft, then you should look for Air-to-air missiles (AAM). If your vehicle should be able to take out ground targets, use Air-to-surface missiles (ASM). Lastly, If you're making a ground vehicle that should be able to take out aircraft, use Surface-to-air missiles (SAM).</p>
<p>Now, with the basic idea of what we want out of the way, let's look at the selections of missiles we can use.
To do this, scroll through the weapons list in the ACF menu and click on the category that matches your desired missile type. A list of available missiles will show up, each of which has its own characteristics and specifications. To find out more about which missile you should use, visit <a href="https://github.com/Bubbus/ACF-Missiles/wiki/Library:-Classes">this guide</a>.</p>
<p>As an example, we're going to look at the AGM-114 Air-to-surface missile. Click on it and a few extra options will open up in your ACF menu.</p>

<p>This is your first important choice, for obvious reasons. Do you want a missile that can take out armoured targets, or one that carries a HE payload large enough to wipe an entire company?
The choice boils down to two available ammo types:</p>
<ul>
<li>HEAT</li>
<li>HE</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're already familiar with ACF's weaponry, this shouldn't be anything new to you. HE warheads will not penetrate any armour, but rather deal enormous splash damage over a large area. HEAT warheads on the other hand are used to penetrate armour, but barely deal any explosive damage, thus requiring a pin-point shot on vital vehicle components (such as the engine or ammo crates).</p>
<p>It's best to try out both ammunition types on some practice targets to get a good idea of how different they are, and to decide which one you should pick.</p>

<p>Once you chose an ammunition type for your missile, the next step is to fill it up with some powdered freedom and democracy, aka HE filler and propellant. These settings have a similar effect on your missile as on regular ACF shells, however with the key difference being that missiles keep accelerating after they've been fired. This is defined as the "burn time" of a missile, and gives you an idea of how long its rocket motor will last before extinguishing.</p>

<p>Burn time is proportional to the amount of propellant added to the missile. The more you add, the longer the missile will be able to fly. However, because every missile type comes with a different shape and mass, some will require far more propellant mass, but still have a shorter burn time. Or the opposite.</p>

<p>By increasing the round length, your missile can carry more propellant and HE filler. For optimal results, make sure the round length is set to maximum, as you would otherwise give away storage capacity (which could be used to deliver freedom over long distances, for example).</p>

<p>The core of the apple. This is what makes the difference between a gentle knock on the enemy tank's armour and a chirurgeon-level engine removal operation. Unless you're recruiting and want people to fire dummy missiles, you should add as much HE filler as you possibly can.</p>

<p>Now we're getting to the really interesting bits. Guidance systems make the difference between a missile that will keep up with its target or just stubbornly fly forward. There are 4 different guidance systems:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dumb</li>
<li>Radar</li>
<li>Wire</li>
<li>Laser</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on what purpose a missile has, the list may contain a more restricted selection of guidance types. This is an expected behaviour, and is in place to prevent unrealistic use of otherwise appropriatedly sized missiles against the wrong target. You wouldn't fire a FIM-92 Stinger at a tank and expect anything major to happen. Neither would you try to hit a jet with a BGM-71E Air-to-surface missile.</p>

<p>The fuse of a missile is what determines when your missile should go boom. There are 4 fuse types available:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact</li>
<li>Optical</li>
<li>Radio</li>
<li>Timed</li>
</ul>
<p>Like with guidance systems, you need to have an idea on what kind of target you intend on fighting with these missiles. If your missile uses a radar guidance to track down aircraft, then it's a good idea to use the radio fuse. If it's unguided, the radio fuse will not work, and you should probably consider contact instead. Anti-armour missils generally use contact fuses, though timed can be a viable option to prevent overshooting.</p>

<p>Got all of that? Good, now go make some boomsticks!</p>
