<p>##Is it normal that guidance misses 90% of times... especially when too close or too far?</p>
<p>It is true that the guidance code of the missiles has trouble with fast-moving targets (~60 km/h and up), which comes down to how it calculates the point of impact. There is no real fix for this other than finding a completely different method of calculating the trajectory altogether.</p>
<p>Here's a bit of insight on what happens in the two scenarios you mentionned:</p>
<ul>
<li>When a target is very close, the missile will have little time to build up speed, which is necessary to steer. If it's too slow, it can't turn quickly enough to hit the target and will miss.</li>
<li>When the target is too far on the other hand, the missile will have ran out of propellant and will use its remaining speed to keep itself moving towards the target. It will essentially glide through the air with its nose facing upward, but will lose a lot of speed in the process. If this gliding phase lasts for too long, the missile will be too slow to maneuver, and will start falling until it detonates on impact.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is true for both moving and static targets, as they're the two "extremes" of the spectrum. Inbetween them, however, is a wide span of chances for your missile to reliably hit its target. Try hitting a static target at 200-300 meters on full propellant, and you should be able to reliably hit with every guided missile type.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that some missiles are best suited for long-range static targets (mostly SAMs), while others are designed for short-range fast-moving targets (AAMs). No missile is really suited for all scenarios, which is why you have to pick the right type for your requirements.</p>
<p>#####EDIT (29.10.2015):
I am currently testing a new approach to the guidance code, which may improve the missiles' accuracy. More information <a href="https://github.com/Bubbus/ACF-Missiles/issues/73">here</a>.

<p>When balancing missiles, certain tradeoffs have to be made. It would be pretty pointless if missile X is better than missile Y in every way. Some of these trade-offs are done for the sake of balancing, while others are due to realism.</p>
<p>As an example: the AGM-114 is designed to be more powerful than the BGM-71E, because it is a lot bigger, and thus carries a heavier HE payload. However, it does so at the expense of agility and motor length.</p>
<p>Let's look at the ranges: The BGM-71E is designed to function as both an ASM, aswell as a SSM (surface to surface). In order to work in surface-to-surface operation, it needs to have more motor burntime to allow long horizontal trajectories.
The AGM-114 on the other hand is designed as an ASM. If you can't get enough range out of them, fly higher - higher altitude means it can glide farther to reach the target.</p>
<p>Of course, there are more factors than the ones listed above. This is especially true for any balancing done across multiple missile platforms, such as AAMs and FFARs. The previous example is meant to give you some insight on why some nerf/buff suggestions get accepted or denied, or why it takes time before we can get back to you.</p>
