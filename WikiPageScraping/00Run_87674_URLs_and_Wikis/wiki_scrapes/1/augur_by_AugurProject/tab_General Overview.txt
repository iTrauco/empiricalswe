<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.1"></a> <strong>Q: What is Augur?</strong></p>
<p>A: Augur is a decentralized prediction market platform built on Ethereum. Users purchase shares in the outcomes of any event, resulting in a stunningly accurate forecast percentage of such outcome occurring. Users can also create their own markets for the outcome of any event.</p>
<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.2"></a> <strong>Q: What moving parts does Augur consist of?</strong></p>
<p>A: <a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-core">Augur Core</a> is the Ethereum smart contracts, <a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur">Augur</a> is the main reference client, and <a href="https://github.com/AugurProject/augur.js">AugurJS</a> is the Javascript API. These are open source and maintained by the Forecast Foundation.</p>
<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.3"></a> <strong>Q: What is the status of Augur?</strong></p>
<p>A: Augur is currently in <a href="app.augur.net">beta</a>, where you can trade with testnet ETH and report with testnet REP. You can view our roadmap towards the v1 'Buffet' release <a href="https://medium.com/@AugurProject/a-roadmap-for-augur-and-whats-next-930fe6c7f75a" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and a rough list of remaining items in our <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Augur/comments/68whru/augur_beta_status_roadmap_and_resources_updated/" rel="nofollow">Reddit thread</a>.</p>
<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.4"></a> <strong>Q: What is the launch plan for Augur?</strong></p>
<p>A: Augur will initially launch with a single bug bounty market, and move towards 'Augur Lite', a deposit / bet limited version of Augur. You can think of it as training wheels in the early weeks of Augur. Once we've had public bug bounties for a bit and Augur Lite is running well, Augur will see a full mainnet launch.</p>
<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.5"></a> <strong>Q: What's going on with reporting during the beta?</strong></p>
<p>A: Reporting is run in 48 hour cycles during the beta for increased testing. The reoccurring time of reporting frequently changes due to resetting of our private chain.</p>
<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.6"></a> <strong>Q: Does Augur plan to support additional login methods?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, Augur plans on supporting the Augur loginID, AirBitz, Ledgers and Trezors in its full release.</p>
<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.7"></a> <strong>Q: What about legal and regulatory issues involving prediction markets?</strong></p>
<p>A: Augur is a platform for prediction markets, where the users of the Augur are the ones who make prediction markets. Users of Augur are responsible for ensuring they are complying with their local jurisdictions laws.</p>
<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.8"></a> <strong>Q: How will Augur raise additional capital?</strong></p>
<p>A: The Forecast Foundation raised $5.3mm USD in a crowdsale by issuing the Reputation token to build Augur. These funds are used for the lifelong development of the protocol. The Forecast Foundation will not raise any additional capital in the lifespan of the project.</p>
<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.9"></a> <strong>Q: Is Augur hiring?</strong></p>
<p>A: We're always interested in hearing from interesting people! If you have an interest in working for Augur, feel free to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:team@augur.net">team@augur.net</a>.</p>
<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.10"></a> <strong>Q: How can I contact Augur / the Forecast Foundation?</strong></p>
<p>A: You can email the team at <a href="mailto:team@augur.net">team@augur.net</a>, or join our <a href="invite.augur.net">Slack</a> and reach out to one of the team members there.</p>
