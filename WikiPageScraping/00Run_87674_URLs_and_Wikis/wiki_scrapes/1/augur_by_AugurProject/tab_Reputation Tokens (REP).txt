<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.1"></a> <strong>Q: What is Reputation (REP)?</strong></p>
<p>A: Reputation is the token behind Augur, and can be thought of as the “score” of an individual participant within Augur. Reputation is not an investment, but rather a tool necessary to make Augur work. The vast majority of Augur participants will never hold, see, or need to use Reputation. It is used as a crypto-economic bond for reporters to properly incentivize accurate reporting.</p>
<hr/>
<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.2"></a> <strong>Q: Where can I purchase REP?</strong></p>
<p>A: REP is available on many crypto markets, such as <a href="poloniex.com">Poloniex</a>, <a href="kraken.com">Kraken</a> and <a href="shapeshift.com">ShapeShift</a>.</p>
<hr/>
<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.3"></a> <strong>Q: Do I need REP to participate in Augur?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, you do not need REP to participate in Augur. To trade in Augur, users will need only ETH as their settlement / trading currency. REP is only required if you wish to participate in Augur as a reporter and earn a portion of the platforms settlement fees.</p>
<hr/>
<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.4"></a> <strong>Q: If I fail to report, do I lose REP?</strong></p>
<p>A: Originally, if you failed to report you would be subject to losing up to 20% of your REP. With the new reporting system, you will only be penalized if you purchase a registration token signal your intent to report, and then fail to do so. If you just hold REP, you are not a risk of losing any REP.</p>
<hr/>
<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.5"></a> <strong>Q: Do I earn more fees if I have more REP?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, the more REP you own, the more of the settlement fees you are entitled to, assuming you report with consensus.</p>
<hr/>
<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.6"></a> <strong>Q: What is the total supply of REP?</strong></p>
<p>A: REP is an Ethereum ERC20 token, and has a fixed issued supply of 11,000,000 REP. 80% of this was sold in a public crowdsale in 2015, and no more REP can ever be created / issued.</p>
<hr/>
<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.7"></a> <strong>Q: What is dormant vs. active REP?</strong></p>
<p>A: Originally in Augur, we had the concept of dormant and active REP to signial your intent to report. With the new reporting system, dormant and active REP has been removed. You now signal your intent to report by purchasing a registration token.</p>
<hr/>
<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.8"></a> <strong>Q: I accidentally send real REP to Coinbase / unsupported wallet. What can I do?</strong></p>
<p>A: You can try to reach out to Coinbase or whatever unsupported wallet you sent the REP to, to see if it can be recovered. From past experiences, Coinbase does <strong>not</strong> usually recover unsupported tokens sent to their wallets.</p>
<hr/>
<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.9"></a> <strong>Q: I sent real REP or ETH to the Augur beta. Is it gone?</strong></p>
<p>A: Nope, don't worry! If you've sent real ETH or REP to the Augur beta, you can download your keystore file on your accounts page. This keystore file can then be used with MyEtherWallet, where you can recover your funds.

<hr/>
<p><a id="user-content-heading-1.10"></a> <strong>Q: Can I mine REP?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, REP is a fixed ERC20 Ethereum token. There is no mining or farming of REP.</p>
