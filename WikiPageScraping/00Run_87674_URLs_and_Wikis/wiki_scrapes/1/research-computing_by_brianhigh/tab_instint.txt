<p>Computers and devices are equipped with a variety of inputs, and
outputs. Inputs and outputs have both physical and virtual components.
On the physical side, is the various ports, connectors, and cables
utilized. On the virtual side, are the various protocols that operate
over the physical interface. That said, physical interfaces aren’t
limited to cabled connections. Wireless both radio frequency and optical
are growing in popularity. Regardless of the physical medium most are
digital, however some, such as audio, are analog.</p>

sensors, and complex instruments. Each of these devices connects via
some interface which could be wired or wireless. Be aware though, that a
peripheral may be available in more than one interface type or may be
equipped with multiple interface options. For example, monitors often
equipped with both analog and digital inputs.</p>

<p>An input/output card expands a computer’s I/O options. These can range
from a basic USB card, to a GPIB controller. Something to keep in mind,
laptop computers tend to be more limited in their I/O expansion options.
If you need more than USB and Ethernet capability, a desktop computer is
recommended.</p>

<p>A bus technology allows multiple devices to share a common medium. With
bus technologies, you can share a single port on your computer with
multiple devices via a bus specific hub or in some cases via daisy

<p>Hewlett-Packard Interface Bus evolved into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE-488" rel="nofollow">General Purpose Interface

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethernet" rel="nofollow">Ethernet</a> is the most common network interface technology. So common,
that most computers built today include Ethernet on-board. Many modern
instruments have native Ethernet support, enabling them to be accessed
directly from a desk, instead of via a computer located next to the
instrument.</p>

<div>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_port" rel="nofollow">Serial</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parallel_port" rel="nofollow">Parallel</a> are both "legacy" interfaces. Their popularity has
been in a decline over the past decade, largely being replaced with USB
and Ethernet. Due to their decline, they aren’t typically seen on modern
computers.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB" rel="nofollow">USB</a> is a fairly universal bus technology. It’s used to connect
everything from keyboards to GPIB interface controllers. It’s found on

<p>Instruments require acquisition software. It translates the raw data
from the instrument into a useful file format, or provides some
additional processing capability. Keep in mind, some software and

software you wish to use will work with your equipment and other tools.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LabVIEW" rel="nofollow">LabVIEW</a> is a popular package due to it’s unique development language,
called G. What sets G a part from others, is the graphical development

<div>
<p>Earlier we introduced the idea of "legacy interfaces" like serial and
parallel, which are showing up on fewer and fewer computers these days.
Which introduces a problem with both hardware and software used to interface
with an instrument.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Let’s take for example a mid 90s vintage HPLC, which is likely to use GPIB to
talk with the computer. While the basic GPIB interface is supported on a
modern system, the instrument may have other requirements. Such as requiring
manufacturer specific software that depends on their own interface card. And,
the interface card uses the ISA bus, a bus that hasn’t been used in computers in
almost 10 years.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>So, why is this a problem? As the computer ages, it’s reliability goes down. In
addition, it’s compatibility with peripherals and software becomes worse over
time. Thus, while the instrument may still do it’s job, you may have difficulty
transferring data from the computer to other systems, printing, etc. These issues
may first appear as minor annoyances, but can quickly evolve into a work stoppage.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>You can help to mitigate this situation, by reviewing the requirements for the
instrument. For instruments that have a very long life, it’s best to avoid ones that
depend on proprietary hardware interfaces. So, look for units that use USB or
Ethernet. Review the software support policy, most manufacturers require you to
purchase updates over time. But, make sure they have plans to support the instrument
long term. In addition, you may want to see if any third-party software vendors
support your instrument, as they have a greater financial interest in supporting
older equipment.</p>

<div>
<p>Up until now, we’ve covered how instruments interface with a computer, software that
interacts with the instrument, and the pitfalls of legacy systems. Now, we must turn
our attention to the overall resource needs of instruments.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In a lab environment, it’s typical to have 1, maybe 2 instruments connected to a single
computer. However, in the interest of saving money, and space some attempt to connect
far more than that to a single computer. If the instruments aren’t being used
simultaneously, you can probably get away with it. But, if you do wish to interact with
many at once, you’re likely to run into issues.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>One group actually attempted to connect a couple dozen instruments in a mobile
environment to a single laptop computer. From a pure software perspective, their tool of
choice, LabVIEW, is designed to interact with multiple devices at once. But, as the number
instruments goes up, the amount of CPU, Memory, and Disk activity also goes up. That said,
their main issue wasn’t with any of those resources, it was with interface technology.
Each instrument connected via USB, which is a bus technology. And, like most bus
technologies, the more devices on the bus, the slower it gets.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>So, when developing a plan involving instruments that require a computer interface, you
must consider more than just the physical connection, and the software support. You must
also consider if the interface technology can really support that many active instruments
at a time. In this example, the lab group ended up purchasing a second computer to divide
up the work load.</p>

<div>
<p>To review. Peripherals are typically external input and output devices, such as keyboards,
and monitors. There are a number of interface technologies on the market, the latest
instruments can be purchased with Ethernet built-in, while most older devices will rely on
GPIB. As for data acquisition, in the field you can use mobile devices like tablets, and
GPS to aid your work. And, in the lab, use software like LabVIEW to process data from an
instrument.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>When purchasing lab instruments or working with older models keep a few things in mind.
Older instruments may not work properly with modern computers. In some cases, the
manufacturer may have a paid option to make it work, such as a software or interface
upgrade. However, that option may be costly, so it’s best to plan ahead for that scenario,
rather than be stuck trying to keep an old computer alive.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Finally, make sure your instrument needs, don’t exceed your computer and interface
limitations. If you exceed those limits, you could face issues with reliable recording of
data to possible hardware damage. Ultimately, planning ahead is likely to save time, and
money.</p>
