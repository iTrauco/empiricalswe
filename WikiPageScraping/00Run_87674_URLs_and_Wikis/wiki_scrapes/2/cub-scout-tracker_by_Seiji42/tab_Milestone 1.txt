          <p>Currently, we have a basic front-end that implements a basic registration page using AngularJS.  This will enable new users to be entered into the database and be given viewing permissions based on the information that has been entered.  On the backend, NodeJS and MySQL have been installed.  The MySQL database has been created with all appropriate table entries.  NodeJS has been explored but no working code has been implemented to interact with the database.  In addition, progress is beginning to be made on a log-in page and plans to begin work on the main requirements page have begun.</p>
<p>All work thus far currently resides within the "dev" branch.</p>
