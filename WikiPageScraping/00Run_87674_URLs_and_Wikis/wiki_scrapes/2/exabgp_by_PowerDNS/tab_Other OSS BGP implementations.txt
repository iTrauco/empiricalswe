<p><strong>I love Python but I prefer twisted</strong></p>
<pre><code>Then look here at pybgp https://code.launchpad.net/pybgp
bzr branch lp:pybgp

I am not sure if this project existed when I started or not but I clearly missed it !	It does not support many RFC, but has IPv4 and VPNv4/MPLS. I really like twisted and use it a lot but did not want a dependency on it for a BGP daemon.

<p><strong>Better, but I want something for my website resilience</strong></p>
<pre><code>You should look at hearbeat.py in ExaBGP but as you insist on not using it, The wikimedia foundation wrote something cool named pybal

<p><strong>I want something which works with OpenStack</strong></p>
<pre><code>In 2014, multiple projects started experimenting with BGP for OpenStack

Orange released BAGPIPE which use ExaBGP's classes to write their own BGP route injector with a clear focus on OpenStack. Some of their code has been ported back in ExaBGP - Thank you for the help.

<p><strong>I want something which works with OpenStack but NOT ExaBGP based</strong></p>
<pre><code>Ok .. we got it ... no point in getting agitated :-)
NTT supports the development of Ruy, which you should have a look at too as it added BGP support in 2014.

<p><strong>Great, I want one from a router vendor, not a network operator</strong></p>
<pre><code>Then you can have a look at what Cisco did with yabgp

<p><strong>You are sure you listed them all ?</strong></p>
<pre><code>No, and I just found (2012-03-19) another python program from 2005 called announcer
