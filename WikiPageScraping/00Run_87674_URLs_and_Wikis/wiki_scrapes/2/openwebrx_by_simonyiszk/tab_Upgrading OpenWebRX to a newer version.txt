<p>When upgrading OpenWebRX, first upgrade csdr:</p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre><span class="pl-c1">cd</span> csdr
git pull 
make <span class="pl-k">&amp;&amp;</span> sudo make install</pre></div>
<p>Only the corresponding (latest) versions of OpenWebRX and csdr will work together.</p>
<p>The OpenWebRX git repository contains the default configuration file <code>config_webrx.py</code> along with the software.
In newer versions of OpenWebRX, the configuration options might change, which makes the upgrade harder to do automatically.</p>
<p>The clean way to upgrade OpenWebRX is to clone the git repository again, and copy your changes from the old <code>config_webrx.py</code> to the new one manually.</p>
<p>However, there is another way as well: <strong>the following sequence of commands might upgrade your current OpenWebRX instance very fast, but there is also a chance that your config file will be screwed up, so you should start by making a backup.</strong></p>
<div class="highlight highlight-source-shell"><pre><span class="pl-c1">cd</span> openwebrx

git status
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> This lists the changes you made under this directory.</span>
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> If anything else than config_webrx.py is modified, you should do a clean reinstall of OpenWebRX.</span>

cp config_webrx.py config_webrx.py.bak      
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Made a backup of the config!</span>

git stash 
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span>This puts your changes to config_webrx.py on the "stack" of the git version control system.</span>

git pull
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> This tries to download the new version from GitHub.</span>

git stash pop 
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> This tries to apply your changes to the current config file.</span>
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> If this does not work, you should manually edit the new config file to copy the correct settings from the old one (config_webrx.py.bak).</span>


less config_webrx.py
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Now check your config file manually!</span>
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> There should be no duplicate entries (the last one would be valid).</span>
<span class="pl-c"><span class="pl-c">#</span> Also if there are any deeper changes in OpenWebRX, you might have to fallback to a new, clean install.</span></pre></div>
