<p>We hope that it can be useful to citizens as a tool for civic engagement, giving them a better understanding of how Legislative bodies work... The project internationalization can spread our approach to analyse lawmakers behaviour in other countries.</p>

<p>The communication occurs through our mailing list, direct e-mail, <a href="https://github.com/radar-parlamentar/radar/issues">issue tracking</a> and eventual video meetings (Hangouts) to keep our core team in touch and committed with the collaborators. The majority of our communications was occurred in Brazilian Portuguese, but, on demand, we can switch to English.</p>

<p>We believe that the nature of the project is very appealing to citizens and civic engagement. Radar Parlamentar deals with insightful government data on the lawmaking process, thus having a strong impact on the real life of every person. The collaborators' engagement is usually related to such aspects as how much the subject interferes with collaborator life, how challenging the project is in terms of technical skills, and how much the core team are adding to their previous knowledge.</p>
<p>We think that this project fulfills all three aspects, connecting democracy, politics, and technology through open government data. Specially in Brazil, facing a strong political crisis and with upcoming elections, this could draw the attention of collaborators to our proposed challenge of building a tool to help understand how politicians behave based on real life (and live) data.</p>

<p>Currently the project focuses on analysing legislative behaviour in Brazil, but our approach is general and indeed we see GSoC as an opportunity to turn Radar Parlamentar into a framework and include more countries in our analysis. An initial challenge can be the amount of Portuguese text the project already has in its documentation and codebase. However, if demanded by new foreign members we can gradually shift our main communication language, as the majority of the team can read and write and communicate in English with mentored students, and translate our codebase as some members of our team have done before with another project (LibreDWG).</p>
