          <p>Air Quality Monitor</p>
<p>An application for users to easily view the air quality of a user's current location, and other locations as well.</p>
<p>Features:</p>
<p>Users will be able to see air quality information for their current location.  Upon authenticating users will see current air conditions for each of the user's added locations.  The user will be able to add or remove locations as he pleases.</p>
<p>Framework: node.js, Angular
Database: mongodb</p>
<p>Description:
This project dedicates to the fighters and victims who are killed in gas explosion in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, R.O.C. This project is reporting local air quality to people who care about Respiratory health. More functions will be added to this project after the end of this semester.</p>
<p>Database Schema:</p>
<p>Future Work:
I have applied ORCA funding to support me to do more research and to build prototype of portable air quality monitor. One the prototype has been finished, we will get into kickstarter stage to get peopleâ€™s funding and issue the monitors to people who like to join our project. By doing so, we can receive more detail air data locally. If we can collect data for more than a year we can possibly predict forest fire before it goes out of control. It can also provide data to other research center for their study of lung cancer and other lung associated diseases.</p>
