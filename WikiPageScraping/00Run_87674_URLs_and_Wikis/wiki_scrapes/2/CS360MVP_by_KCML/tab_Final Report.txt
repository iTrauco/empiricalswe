          <p><strong>Description:</strong></p>
<p>This project is dedicated to the victims who were killed in various gas explosions in Kaohsiung City, Taiwan, R.O.C.</p>
<p>Our application's purpose it to help people track the air quality in various locations.</p>

When a user first lands at the page, their current location is displayed with the air quality in that location.  If the air quality is not good or moderate, the user then knows that there are potential health risks to spending too much time outside in his/her current location.</p>

A user can click to authenticate with facebook.</p>

After authenticating users can enter a zipcode, to add a location to their airquality list. They can also remove locations from that list.  A user’s air quality list is saved, and thus whenever a user reauthenticates the same list will appear.</p>
<p><strong>Database Schema:</strong></p>
<p><img alt="" data-canonical-src="http://s13.postimg.org/92ylvbb47/Screen_Shot_2014_12_10_at_11_58_21_PM.png" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/a6070367698d3fa4b64d00213f30e7a16d6c4abd/687474703a2f2f7331332e706f7374696d672e6f72672f3932796c76626234372f53637265656e5f53686f745f323031345f31325f31305f61745f31315f35385f32315f504d2e706e67"/></p>
<p>Each user has multiple authentication methods.  Currently we have only implemented facebook however in the future we would like users to have the ability to authenticate via email and password.  If the email of the user authenticating already exists in the db under a current user’s facebook account, new local login credentials will be added to that user’s profile.</p>
<p><strong>Future Work:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In the future we will add more authentication strategies, such as twitter authentication and local authentication.</li>
<li>Currently, new locations can only be added by zipcode, in the future we would like to be able to add new locations by city name, or coordinates.</li>
<li>To obtain air data for a given location, we use the AirNow api which limits to 500 requests per hour.  We would like to implement a caching service in order to reduce the number of requests to the AirNow servers</li>
</ul>
<p>ORCA funding has been applied to support this project for further development. In order to make the project more useful in the future, collecting more detailed data through users is very necessary. I (mike) am currently building a air quality monitor/tracker prototype that collects the chemical ingredients and particle amounts in the air. The prototype also will have a gas sensor built in with humidity and temperature sensors. It also come with GPS to give accurate longitude and latitude. The data will be sent to the Internet through ATMEL WINC1500 wifi module to make sure the data is encrypted and can be sent to our database without being hacked. After a year of collecting data, we can use the accumulate result from database and get to further usage such as, study of lung cancer and other Respiratory health issues.  To make people join program. We can use kickstarter to get people’s funding and issue the monitors to people who would like to join our project in order to begin gathering data.</p>
