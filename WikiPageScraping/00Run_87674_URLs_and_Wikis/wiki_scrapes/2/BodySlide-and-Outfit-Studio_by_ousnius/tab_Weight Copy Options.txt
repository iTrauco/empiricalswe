          <p>When you <strong>copy bone weights</strong> in Outfit Studio, an options dialog pops up. It looks like the following.</p>
<p><img alt="Weight Copy Options" data-canonical-src="http://i.imgur.com/bMV8lXi.png" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/f27487cd6a9377754ba7942fbec92e57fcc4e0d3/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f624d56386c58692e706e67"/></p>
<p>As the description in the dialog mentions, every single vertex of the source will <strong>spread its bone weights to the maximum amount of vertices</strong> in the target that you set it to, provided they are within the search radius.</p>
<p>In this amazingly painted example, the green circle is the source vertex, the red circles are all of the target vertices and the radius is shown in blue.</p>
<p><img alt="Search Radius" data-canonical-src="http://i.imgur.com/q2yXsIk.png" src="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/43747ef0d813c44e1b83d20046fd82ef8dc883e5/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f7132795873496b2e706e67"/></p>
<p>There are <strong>5 vertices within the search radius</strong>, but with a maximum of 4 vertex targets, <strong>only 4 of them will receive weights</strong> from that one source. Of course, they can and will still receive weights from other sources.</p>
<p>All of the weights received will be averaged out with a maximum of 4 different bones that can affect a single vertex.</p>
