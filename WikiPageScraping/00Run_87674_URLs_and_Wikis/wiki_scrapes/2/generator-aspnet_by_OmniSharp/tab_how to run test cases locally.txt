          <p>As you are making changes to the generators you will want to run the test cases locally to ensure they pass before committing or submitting a new PR. The test cases are mocha test cases so you'll need mocha to execute those tests.</p>
<p>There are a few things that need to be installed to get the test cases to run. You can install those with the following commands.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>npm install yeoman-generator</code></li>
<li><code>npm install mocha</code></li>
<li><code>npm install chalk</code></li>
</ul>
<p>After that you should be able to execute <code>npm test</code> to run the test cases from the <code>generator-aspnet</code> directory.</p>
