Statics are resources that are already in their distributable form and you would usually serve them in a public directory and include them in your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet"&gt;</code>. For example the jQuery library, a precompiled Bootstrap CSS or its icon fonts.
#JS - Closure Compiler conform
The JS sources in silksmith are JavaScript sources that will be "compiled" by Google's Closure Compiler and come with valid <a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/js-for-compiler" rel="nofollow">JSDoc annotations</a> and <code>goog.provide("my.Class")</code> and <code>goog.require("your.Class")</code> calls.
#Externs
<a href="https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/docs/api-tutorial3" rel="nofollow">Externs</a> are part of the Closure Compiler minification process. They describe the interface how to interact with precompiled libraries. During the compile process, the compiler will check if you call for example jQuery in the correct way. So if you have a static js resource that you call from the closure js code, you should provide the externs here.
#SCSS
Silksmith also supports <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" rel="nofollow">SASS</a> with SCSS syntax. Packages that provide scss sources will automatically be in the SASS <em>include_path</em></p>
