          <p>Those classes provide a very generic interface for the common components in Bayesian reinforcement learning.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>IAgent class</strong>, defines an interface for an agent.</li>
<li>
<strong>IMDP class</strong>, defines an interface for an MDP.</li>
<li>
<strong>IMDPDistribution class</strong>, defines an interface for a MDP distribution.</li>
<li>
<strong>IExperiment class</strong>, defines an interface for an experiment.</li>
</ul>
<p>All <code>IXXX</code> classes are derived from class <code>Serializable</code>.</p>

<p>It is a template defining a generic way to perform an experiment. It has been designed to be applicable in many configurations (e.g.: continuous state/action space, multiple rewards, ...).</p>
<p>An experiment can be seen as a set of samples to be tested. Testing a sample aims to run a certain agent on a certain MDP over a certain number of trajectories. Every single trajectory is stored. In the future, we want to develop specific tools to analyse those trajectories and learn more about the agents' behaviour.</p>
<p>An <code>IExperiment</code> instance can run for a certain amount of time, and continue from where it stops. This feature has been introduced to allow us to create backups periodically. An experiment can run for several days/weeks/months, and an unexpected event can occur at any time (e.g.: a power cut). We believe this feature will help you not to waste your time.</p>
<p>Finally, <code>IExperiment</code> is multi-threaded. It can run several samples in parallel (one per thread). In this case, ensure using the same machine and the same number of threads when continuing an experiment from a backup (in order to keep consistency in computation times).</p>
