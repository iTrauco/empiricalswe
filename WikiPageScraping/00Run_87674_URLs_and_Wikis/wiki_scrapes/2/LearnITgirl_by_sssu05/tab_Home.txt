          <p>Welcome to my LearnITgirl wiki!</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago an awesome adventure has started.
In the middle of November I received the most wanted e-mail the one that was meant to announce me that I will be one of the lucky scholars of the Learn IT, girl project.
I just couldn't wait for my mentor to contact me and start working on my idea.
After we establish what we will do and how we want to do it, i started a basic course about HTML and CSS and read some info about GitHub.
After finishing the course I, had a more clearer picture html means and how it works.
I also understood the HTML structure, like table, divs and span, how to make clickable photos and how to create lists.
The CSS part of this course showed me how to make the pages even prettier then you can make it just using html. I learned how to create buttons and how to use classes and IDs.</p>
<p>During the next period I will have to start working hard on my idea.
Having a few basic info about the programming languages that I will use and a great mentor to guide me through my work...it should be a piece of cake.</p>
