          <p>This project only scratches the surface of object recognition.
Areas for further research and development might include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Increasing the "depth" of the feature extraction. The literature reviewed suggest 2 obvious enhancements:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>encoding higher level features in the hidden layers of deep networks, and/or</li>
<li>selecting prototype images from the training set and evaluating a "distance" measure to those prototypes.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Personal interest would also include training a set of auto-associative networks, one for each class.</li>
<li>Utilize the color channels in a more constructive manner.</li>
<li>Implementation of algorithms for "fast" execution. Notably many of the neural networks deployed in this area have been hand coded in a low level language for execution on a GPU.</li>
<li>Augmenting the training set. Expand the training set by rotating images, reflecting images and minor translational shifts.</li>
<li>Investigate methods of dimensional reduction. Although this is less of an imperative than might be initially thought. There is limitless data!</li>
</ol>
