          <p>Each image underwent some simple preprocessing prior to feature extraction.</p>
<p>All the images are in color with 3 channels, namely a red, green and blue channel. The images were converted to grayscale, which meant only a single channel for each of the 32 by 32 pixels.</p>
<p>The grayscale images underwent histogram normalization. Noramalizing a histogram is a technique that ensures that the pixel intensities are spread across the entire range of possible values. The net effect of this technique is to improve the overall image contrast. This pre-processing was performed in an attempt to provide each image with an "equal" baseline contrast.</p>
