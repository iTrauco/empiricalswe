          <p>As you've hopefully noticed by playing through frogatto, we are able to take our art, and change the colors on it to a different theme, on separate levels.  Halfway through the seaside segment of the game (at the level "Secluded Hut"), the art turns from brown foreground/standable rocks paired with grey background rocks, to greenish foreground rocks and red background rocks.  This can be done to both tile art, and object art.</p>
<p>Doing this is fairly simple - you create a file with two columns of pixels in it - the left column is the source pixels (the color of the art as it appears in the raw graphics files), the right column is the result pixels.  This file should be given a relevant name, and places in images/palette.</p>
<p>If a level has <code>palettes="palette_image_name"</code> inside it, all objects and all tiles which declare that they use that palette will be shifted.  The one exception is background art, which requires a similar <code>background_palette="palette_image_name"</code> in the level file (this was separated because backgrounds can often be very different colors from the level art).</p>
<p>To declare that an object uses a palette, all of its animations (easily done by putting this in the <code>[base:animation]</code> tag) must have a key that lists all the palettes that use it, separated by commas.  E.g. <code>palettes=palette1,palette2,etc</code>  The act of declaring objects is a big optimisation; checking their colors for palette-shiftings is expensive, and only doing it when it deliberately says it needs to be changed is an enormous savings (otherwise on every level, the game would have to check every object to see if it corresponded with the current palette being used.</p>
