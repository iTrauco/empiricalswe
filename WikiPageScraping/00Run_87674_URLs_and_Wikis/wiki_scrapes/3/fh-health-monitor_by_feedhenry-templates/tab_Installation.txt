<p>After this installation process is complete, you will not be able to view the monitor yet. To view the monitor the project needs to be made public. To do this enter the Service's configuration screen in the studio and in Service Settings under Security put a tick into 'Make this Service Public to all Projects and Services' click save, and then re-deploy the service.</p>
<p>The Monitor can then be viewed either in the preview section of the studio, or else at the URL listed under 'Current Host' in the deploy page.</p>
