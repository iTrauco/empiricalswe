          <p>#<strong>Necessity is the mother of all invention</strong> - Albert Einstein</p>
<p>This is the very reason for this junk to come into git.</p>
<p>Any way I have to fill this page with some nonsense, otherwise your click goes for waste, right?</p>
<p>I always had and having a LOVE(dream might die off one day, but not love!) for creating some kind of robots, but lacked the energy to do it for lot of reasons, what a typical Indian face in his young age. That doesn't stop me exploring things in the internet, you know why? it is free.</p>
<p>I chosen my engineering degree,  Electronics and Instrumentation, after knowing it would help me living my dream at some point in my life, and it is helping me for sure.</p>
<p>All this started when I started my first <a href="http://i-vizon.blogspot.in/2013/03/about-i-vizon.html" rel="nofollow">blog</a> and number of visitors to my blog was and is my inspiration to explore more and know what other people searching for?</p>
<p>First I started with exploring Camera as a sensor (thinking I can give the gift of sight to machines) and came across <a href="http://opencv.org/" rel="nofollow">OpenCV</a>, yeah it was late, too late. Why? First I need the gift of mathematics and hell lot of Algorithms understanding to give the so called "gift of sight to the machine".</p>
<p>Then I started exploring 3D sensors based on <a href="http://structure.io/openni" rel="nofollow">OpenNI</a> and <a href="http://pointclouds.org/" rel="nofollow">PCL</a> which is again a big stream to start off, unless you are a student or researcher and no scope in India for any foreseeable future... Okay why do I care for the scope? After all I need a job, if some one chucks me out my current job right, to marry and to do etc etc..,</p>
<p>Then I turned my attention towards GPGPU based on OpenCL and made some contribution at [Boost Compute] (<a href="https://github.com/kylelutz/compute">https://github.com/kylelutz/compute</a>), <strong>YES!!! I made my first contribution to a Open Source</strong>. However that didn't give me a satisfaction and yet again why? Kyle Lutz is so much of perfectionist(at least for me), to push few lines of code I had to spend hours, nevertheless it was and is the best motivation I ever had/having for my coding skills.</p>
<p>Coming back to the story, soon I end up a stage where I cant learn something out of air, as I need some base for a better focussing. A bit of search revealed that long rusted interest of mine on Artificial Neural Networks, doesn't have a good library for beginners and students that can be tried directly on the embedded hardware(might be there somewhere), so I thought of converging OpenCL, OpenCV, PCL and ANN with a library that can be directly tested on hardware.</p>
<p>Did I forgot to mention about <a href="http://ros.org/" rel="nofollow">ROS</a>?</p>
<p>I got your mind voice, I will stop here.</p>
