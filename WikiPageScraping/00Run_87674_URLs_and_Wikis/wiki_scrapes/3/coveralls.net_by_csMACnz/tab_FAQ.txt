          <p><strong>The version keeps changing when I update through nuget, how do I make my path to the csmacnz.coveralls.exe file in the packages folder dynamic in PowerShell?</strong></p>
<p>you can use <code>$coveralls = (Resolve-Path "src/packages/coveralls.net.*/csmacnz.coveralls.exe").ToString()</code> to resolve and store the path, then you can call it using <code>.$coveralls --monocov ...</code>.  Just make sure you only reference one version of the nuget package, or else this will not work.</p>
