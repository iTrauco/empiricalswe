<p>The organization of GWP is similar to putting WordPress in its own subdirectory but with some improvements.</p>
<p>In order not to expose sensitive files in the webroot, GWP moves what's required into a web/ directory including the vendor'd cms/ source, and the wp-content source.
wp-content has been named app to better reflect its contents. It contains application code and not just "static content". It also matches up with other frameworks such as Symfony and Rails.
wp-config.php remains in the web/ because it's required by WP, but it only acts as a loader. The actual configuration files have been moved to config/ for better separation.
vendor/ is where the Composer managed dependencies are installed to.
cms/ is where the WordPress core lives. It's also managed by Composer but can't be put under vendor due to WP limitations.</p>
