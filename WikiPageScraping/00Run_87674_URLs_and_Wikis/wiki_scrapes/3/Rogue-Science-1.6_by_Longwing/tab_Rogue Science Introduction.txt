          <p>You are standing on ruins. Yes, even here amidst this placid forest, the bones of dead civilizations can be found beneath your feet. This world is old. Nations have risen and fallen where you stand. The ancient sorcerers who came before you touched every corner of this place, and bent the laws of the world to their whims.
Now all that remain are ruins. The incredible knowledge of the old world is all but lost. All we have now are fragments, tiny pieces of rogue science to defend ourselves against the dark.</p>
<p>###Welcome to Rogue-Science-1.6.4</p>
<p>I am delighted to announce the launch of the Rogue Science Modpack after literally years of development (where does the time go!?). Rogue Science is a heavily modified Minecraft install that places a strong emphasis on exploration and adventure, while also adding tons of new toys for seasoned builders to play with. This document will serve as a central repository of knowledge about the mods and world of Rogue Science.</p>
