<p>Major mods make significant changes to minecraft by adding new mechanics or changing world generation</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong><a href="http://atomicstryker.net/battletowers.php" rel="nofollow">Atomic Stryker's Battletowers</a></strong> - This adds the huge towers that dot the landscape. Climbing to the top will reveal the tower boss. Beating him will cause the tower to collapse.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="http://www.bibliocraftmod.com/?page_id=55" rel="nofollow">Bibliocraft</a></strong> - This mod adds several new pieces of furniture, notably a much better bookshelf. While largely decorative, several recepies can be used to copy enchanted books (for an XP cost).</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1286162-biomes-o-plenty-over-75-new-biomes-plants-and-more" rel="nofollow">Biomes O Plenty</a></strong> - Adds a ton of new biomes. About half are enabled.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1278075-chocolate-quest-mods-for-the-adventurers" rel="nofollow">Chocolate Quest</a></strong> (AKA Better Dungeons) - Generates tons of additional Dungeons (you can blame this for the pirates)</li>
<li>
<strong>[Dimensional Doors] (<a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1287583-dimensional-doors-v2-2-4" rel="nofollow">http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1287583-dimensional-doors-v2-2-4</a>)</strong> - Adds pocket dimensions and Dimensional Dungeons, along with related items, such as the doors themselves.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="http://mocreatures.org/" rel="nofollow">Dr. Zhark's Mo'Creatures</a></strong> - Adds a TON of new animals, insects, and about half of the new monsters.</li>
<li>
<strong><a href="http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding/minecraft-mods/1286469-enchanting-plus" rel="nofollow">Enchanting Plus</a></strong> - Adds an enhanced enchanting table (crafted from a normal enchanting table), which lets you dial enchantments instead of getting them randomly.</li>
<li>
<strong>Extra Biomes XL</strong> - Adds even more custom biomes, about half of these are enabled, overly similar ones from BOP and EBXL are disabled.</li>
<li>
<strong>Finder Compass</strong> - Converts the normal compass into a magical one that detects minierals, because branch mining is boring and annoying.</li>
<li>
<strong>Floating Ruins</strong> - Adds (most) of the circular floating islands that have been "torn" from the landscape below. These each have a small dungeon with loot on them.</li>
<li>
<strong>Infernal Mobs</strong> - Adds the various "super" mobs you've encountered. These have Diablo style modifiers that grant special powers. Killing them normally drops at least one enchanted item.</li>
<li>
<strong>Mystcraft</strong> - Adds the entire mythology of Myst to minecraft. Write books to take you to new Ages (dimensions) but beware that you don't get trapped there! Always bring a linking book with you to return to the overworld.</li>
<li>
<strong>Natura</strong> - Adds some worldgen (ores like copper, aluminum, tin), also adds the berry bushes, some other plants, and a few rare trees. Meant to be used in conjunction with Tinkers Construct.</li>
<li>
<strong>Not Enough Items</strong> - NEI allows you to research many recipes from inside minecraft. Search for an item to see how it's made. Doesn't always work on odder items, such as Tinker's Construct or Thaumcraft stuff.</li>
<li>
<strong>Project Zulu</strong> - Adds a TON of new dungeons, some new plants, and a TON of new creatures and Mobs.</li>
<li>
<strong>RedLogic</strong> - Adds advanced redstone gates and some special redstone processing.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ruins Spawning System</strong> - Adds pre-constructed ruins, some tiny (like fountains or wreaked houses), some huge (he floating castle off the coast is an example).</li>
<li>
<strong>Thaumcraft 4.1</strong> - Adds a deep and complex magic system to Minecraft</li>
<li>
<strong>The Twilight Forest</strong> - Adds an entire extra dimension with it's own mobs, biomes, bosses, loot, etc.</li>
<li>
<strong>Tinker's Construct</strong> - Adds the ability to craft new items via smelting. The system is complex, and exists in parallel to normal crafting. Some really interesting items to be had here.</li>
</ul>

<p>Minor mods add small edits to minecraft to improve player experience</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Animated Player Mod</strong> - This gives players elbows and knees.</li>
<li>
<strong>Armor Bar</strong> - This shows the durability of your currently equipped armor</li>
<li>
<strong>Backpack</strong> - This adds a small collection of Backpacks. These act as portable bags/chests and can be made from common cow leather.</li>
<li>
<strong>Better Sprinting</strong> - This allows you to rebind the sprint function to something other than double-tap</li>
<li>
<strong>Bibliowoods</strong> - This adds more wood colors to Biblocraft furniture, so they look like the wood the're made from (not all wood is supported, but many are).</li>
<li>
<strong>BuffBar</strong> - Adds status effects and their durations to the user interface.</li>
<li>
<strong>Crystal Wing</strong> - Adds a single "Return to base" item.</li>
<li>
<strong>Custom Recipes</strong>  - Mostly adds the ability to turn mined coal into ink, and to cook zombie meat into leather. Other recipes may be forthcoming later. Suggestions?</li>
<li>
<strong>Damage Indicators</strong> - Shows mob health when in sights.</li>
<li>
<strong>Inventory Tweaks</strong> - Adds buttons and shortcuts for sorting chests and inventories. Enables shift cliking, along with click-and-hold for placing things in crafting tables.</li>
<li>
<strong>Just Another Spawner</strong> - Allows me to centralize and control the mob spawns from the various mods, adjusting frequency and what biome they spawn in.</li>
<li>
<strong>Nether Ores</strong> - Adds ore to the nether. The ore will sometimes anger pigmen, and sometimes explode. So be careful.</li>
<li>
<strong>Reliquary</strong> - Adds a pile of neat new weapons.</li>
<li>
<strong>Ropes+</strong> - Adds rope (and other) arrows.</li>
<li>
<strong>Secret Rooms Mod</strong> - Adds camouflage paint (make doors with textures like stone, dirt, book cases, etc. Also adds one way glass, and illusory blocks (look real but walk through them). None of these spawn with the world, but can be crafted for base-making fun.</li>
<li>
<strong>Treecapitator</strong> - If you chop the lowest block of a tree with an Axe, the whole tree will fall. Sometimes claims nearby trees/logs by mistake.</li>
<li>
<strong>Wild Caves 3</strong> - Adds stalactites, stalagmites, mushrooms, skulls, vines, and other small decorations to caves so they're less dull.</li>
</ul>
