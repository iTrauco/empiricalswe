          <p>There are several new items and recipes you should be aware of. These are designed to make some of the more annoying elements of Minecraft a lot less annoying:</p>

<p>Rotten flesh can now be converted to leather in a furnace. Since both Thaumcraft and Mystcraft rely heavily on books, this makes the creation of new books a heck of a lot easier.<br/>

<p>###Coal to ink sac
This simple recipe makes it easy to get more ink for Thaumcraft and Mystcraft. One Coal becomes one ink sac when placed on a crafting table. Ink sacs can then be used to make Ink Vials. This is a lot easier than hunting for squid, and real ink is made from carbon all the time anyways.</p>
<p>###The Crystal Wing
This item will allow you to instantly return to your starting point or bed. While a bit unstable for inter-dimensional travel (it doesn't always work right), it's a great way to get back to your home base in a pinch.<br/>

<p>###Special Arrows
A number of new Arrows have been added to the game, these can be fired from a normal bow.  There's a good demonstration of the available recipes introduced by this mod in the Youtube video linked below. The most notable is probably the Rope arrow, which allows you to place climbable ropes just about anywhere.</p>

<p>###Finder's Compass
The normal compass has been replaced with the far more useful Finder's compass. Hold a compass in your hand and right click without a block selected. This will cycle you through the compass's modes. This is in the game expressly to ELIMINATE branch mining. Head down to the bottom of the world, set the compass to "Shiny Stones" and watch for a blue needle as you explore. While it won't hand you diamonds for free, you can now zero in on diamond deposits without having to clear whole chunks just to find them.<br/>

<p>###Better Enchanting
Tired of randomly burning levels at the enchanting table, only to see another useless "Bane of Anthropods IV"? Well, there's a better enchanting table available if you've got the resources to make it. This new table lets you set your enchantments to whatever you'd like, as long as you've got the levels to fuel it.<br/>

<p>###Backpacks
Backpacks are a convenient way to expand your inventory for long journeys. A basic backpack only costs 8 leather. More complex models are also available. To use a backpack, place it in your hotbar and right-click. This will bring up a separate inventory.<br/>

<p>###Knapsacks
Knapsacks are provided by the Tinker's Construct mod. They provide a permanent extra inventory. Unlike Backpacks, which use common ingredients, Knapsacks require Tinker's Construct materials, created using a smelter and molds.<br/>
Specifically, the recipe calls for two Tough Iron Rods. For reference, see the Tinker's Construct section.<br/>
