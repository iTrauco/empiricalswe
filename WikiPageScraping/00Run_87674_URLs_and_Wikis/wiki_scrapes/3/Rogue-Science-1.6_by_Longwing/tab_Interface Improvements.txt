<p>NEI allows you to quickly check most of the items and recipes in Rogue Science. Anything that can be made using a normal crafting table, a furnace, or even a Tinkers Construct Smeltery can be researched here. This takes some of the mystery out of building new objects.</p>
<p>Search for an item by typing it's name in the bar at the bottom center.</p>
<p>Left click to see what an item can be used FOR</p>
<p>Or right click any item to see how to make it.</p>
