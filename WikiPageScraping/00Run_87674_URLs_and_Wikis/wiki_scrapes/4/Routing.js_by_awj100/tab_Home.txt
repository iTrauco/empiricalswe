          <p>The <a href="https://github.com/awj100/Routing.js/wiki/Getting-Started">Getting Started</a> page should get you up and running, showing you how to define routes, take action when a route is called, defining route parameters and so forth.</p>
<p>The <code>routes</code> property exposes an object with some useful properties, and can be read about <a href="https://github.com/awj100/Routing.js/wiki/The-%60routes%60-Object">here</a>.</p>
<p>If you'd like to extend your knowledge of what's going on under the covers then read about <a href="https://github.com/awj100/Routing.js/wiki/The-%60route%60-Object-%28Advanced%29">the <code>Route</code> object</a> as well as some <a href="https://github.com/awj100/Routing.js/wiki/Additional-Functions">additional functions</a> which Routing.js exposes. However, this knowledge isn't necessary for using Routing.js</p>
