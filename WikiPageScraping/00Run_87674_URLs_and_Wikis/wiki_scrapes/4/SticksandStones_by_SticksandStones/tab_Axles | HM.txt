          <p>In Hard Mode, axles are suddenly a challenge. You can't just plonk down an axle and expect it to work; you have to give it proper care. Axles can be good or bad for the situation, and you've got to think carefully about every placement.
In other words... The Flow has been blocked.</p>

<p>The Thaumium axle can repair itself with centivis, at 1 durability/s for 5 CV of all aspects. The Voidmetal axle will repair itself at 1 durability/s without CV, and with 5 CV of all aspects, at 1 durability/t. However, Voidmetal will warp any player standing near it while it turns, and any excess stress will tear it completely apart.<br/>
The Terrasteel axle can absorb mana from nearby pools, like a flower, and repair itself at 1 durability/t. The Elemental axle, forged from Gaia spirits, has the same effect, but also ignores gravity like the Kenaf rope it's made from.</p>
<p><code>*</code> Flint axles will start a fire below them when connected to an iron axle, and turning with at least 2 torque.<br/>
<code>**</code> Redstone axles will emit a signal based on how much speed they are currently rotating with, out of 20. A comparator output will give the torque, out of 20.<br/>
<code>***</code> Bedrock axles can only be obtained in creative mode, and have no crafting recipe. They are also not affected by gravity stress.<br/>
<code>****</code> Quartz axles will light up as they turn, a piezoelectric property. The light level is equal to the torque; 15 torque is maximum light, and 0 is no light.<br/>
<code>*****</code> Ropes, the Elemental axle, and Graphene sheets, will not be affected by gravity stress, and will break as though they had 0 hardness.</p>

<p>If your axle isn't magical or graphene, it's going to break eventually. If it's metal, optics ends up being your answer. Focusing a beam of at least red-frequency heat on the axle will cause it, and all metal axles for 5 blocks connected to it, to fuse back together. This will repair them by 100 durability/s but increase their resistance for half a minute by 5.</p>
<p>If it's a dust, such as redstone, or netherrack, you can simply add on more material. Drop more material on, and it will fuse into the rest of the axle, fully restoring it.</p>
<p>Stone-type materials, such as flint, quartz, or obsidian, are also restored by optics. Focus a green or blue-frequency heat laser on such an axle, and it will start to soften a little bit, making it nearly impossible to transfer energy through it. However, it will repair at 10 durability/s during this time.</p>
<p>Crystal, bone, wooden, and rope axles cannot be restored, only replaced.</p>

<p>Durability, simply, is how long the material will last. This is affected by the other stats. If it's zero, the material will shatter, and the danger of this shattering is determined by the Hardness stat.</p>
<p>Oxidizability is how much the material will decay over time. Over each minute, an axle will lose durability equal to its oxidizability stat.</p>
<p>Resistance is how much torque the material will take off per whole-axle connection. This is averaged in axles where you connect multiple types of axle. Every material will take damage equal to its resistance for every ten seconds it's turning.</p>
<p>Hardness is how much torque a material can take. If the torque is greater than the material's hardness, the axle will take damage at 100 durability/s, and will break quite quickly. Hardness also determines the backlash when a material shatters; the higher the hardness, the farther you can be before you start to take damage, and the higher the damage dealt. Like a splash potion, the axle will harm players closest to the blast first, but unlike a potion, it will not harm through walls. Axle explosions can destroy glass.</p>
<p>Gravity affects durability as well; the more axles you have in a line, and the higher up they are, the more damage the axle will take. The only axles immune to this are Ropes, the Elemental axle, and Graphene sheets.
Gravity also affects resistance. If you try to transfer energy upwards without Graphene or a Sharded Axle, it will increase the resistance of the axle by 10, meaning that it's far easier to keep your production skywards.</p>

<p>Kenaf Oil, obviously, acts as a lubricant. If you coat an axle in it (this can be done with one axle per bucket, or 8 per bucket), that axle will lose 3 resistance. This cannot drop an axle's resistance to 0. This will not apply to Graphene.</p>
<p>Sticky Messes act as glue, keeping the axle in one piece. You can combine an unlubricated axle with a sticky mess to get an axle with 50% more durability, but 5 more resistance as well. This cannot be applied to Graphene.</p>
<p><code>[A]</code> Rubbing Chromium Fillings onto an axle will reduce its oxidizability to 1, making it last far longer than it would normally. This cannot be applied to Graphene or Ropes.</p>
<p><code>[TC]</code> Strapping Shards onto a Thaumium axle with Kenaf Rope (up to 4, of different kinds) will create a Sharded Axle. These change the stats of the whole axle line, but make the line require 2 CV of each aspect of shard strapped on. A balanced shard will require 10 CV of each primal instead.<br/>
An <strong>Entropy Shard</strong> will transform speed to torque, to the resistance of the line plus 3.<br/>
An <strong>Order Shard</strong> will increase the hardness of the line by 5.<br/>
A <strong>Water Shard</strong> will decrease the resistance of the line by 2. This can't reduce it below 0.<br/>
A <strong>Fire Shard</strong> will transform torque to speed, down to 1 speed.<br/>
An <strong>Earth Shard</strong> will suspend all oxidization along the line.<br/>
An <strong>Air Shard</strong> will negate upwards gravitational effects.<br/>
A <strong>Balanced Shard</strong> will suspend all resistance damage dealt to the line of axes.<br/>
If a Sharded Axle has both an <strong>Entropy</strong> and a <strong>Fire Shard</strong>, it will convert to as equal torque and speed as possible.<br/>
Sharded Axes will not turn on axle lines with Ropes or Graphene in them.<br/>
If you don't provide CV to a Sharded Axle the line will not turn. However, the axle will not try to use CV if you're not passing it torque.<br/>
You can't have more than one Sharded Axle on a line at a time.</p>

<p>At the first tier, axles are simple to craft. Minerals are bound in string, and everything else is bound in wood. However, you can bind wood in finer materials, such as string or leather hide, to make a better axle.<br/>
The crafting recipe for t1 axles goes as such:<br/>
<code>B B</code><br/>
<code>MMM</code><br/>
<code>B B</code><br/>
B is the binding material, and M is the shaft material.</p>
<p>At the second tier, things get a little harder. Kenaf rope must be the binding material, as nothing else is quite strong enough. Kenaf Rope itself must be bound with Iron. Iron-Woven Kenaf Rope is the only exceptional recipe. It is crafted like so:<br/>
<code>BIB</code><br/>
<code>MMM</code><br/>
<code>BIB</code><br/>
B is the binding, iron. M is the shaft material, Kenaf Rope. I is Iron Coil, a product of your optics research.</p>
<p>Graphene is crafted much more interestingly. To begin with, you must put a diamond in a chamber of glass, so no gas can escape. You must then blast it with an ultraviolet and infrared laser simultaneously, which will sublimate the diamond. Then, after a second or two, you can take out the graphite that formed on the top of the glass chamber. Now, you must set it on an Etching Table, and let the laser cut through the graphite sheet, leaving a single sheet of Graphene. This doesn't need to be bound; a line of three graphene will do the trick, making an axle that can't connect to any other axles, but can transfer energy almost seamlessly.</p>
