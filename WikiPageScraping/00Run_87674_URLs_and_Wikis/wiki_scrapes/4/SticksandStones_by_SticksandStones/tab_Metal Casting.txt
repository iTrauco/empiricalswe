          <p>For large items (such as Iron Rods), you need a Casting Basin, a block when placed to other Basins, creates a larger area for casting.
Filling the basin with Greensand half way allows for the player to put a foam object in for Lost Foam Casting, then fill in the rest. Use a stick on a part of the Basin after all the Greensand has been put in for the hole you'll be pouring into.</p>
<p>The hole will spout flame at first, then sputter to smoke, then once it's done smoking, it's time to dig your hunk of metal up.</p>
<p>The Tools required for this kind of casting are a Stick and a Shovel of any sort.
A Shovel to press down the Greensand, but to as well dig out the Greensand from the casting.
A Stick for pressing a hole in a part of the Greensand after you're done covering it up, allowing the molten metal to flow in.</p>
