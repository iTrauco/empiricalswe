          <p>You can find the main project files to compile the engine under engine/compilers. As of right now the only available option is Visual Studio 2012. After compiling the engine you must either copy the compiled files into a project directory or in Visual Studio set the Working Directory to whichever project you want to run.</p>
<p>For example in Visual Studio in the Project menu, under Properties -&gt; Configuration Properties -&gt; Debugging if we set the Working Directory to projects/ExampleProject we can launch ExampleProject from Visual Studio. Alternatively if we copied the compiled files into the ExampleProject folder we can run it from there.</p>
