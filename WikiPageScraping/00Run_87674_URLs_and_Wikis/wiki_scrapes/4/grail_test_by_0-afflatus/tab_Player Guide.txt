<p>"The theme of the Grail is the bringing of life into what is known as the wasteland." ~ Joseph Campbell.</p>
<p>"You can't expect to wield supreme executive power just because some watery tart threw a sword at you." ~ Dennis, Monty Python and the Holy Grail.</p>
<p>"None of them had any idea where the Holy Grail really was, and I don't think any of them actually expected to find it, or would have known what to do with it if he had run across it." ~ Mark Twain, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.</p>
<p>"That rabbit's got a vicious streak a mile wide!" ~ Tim the Enchanter, Monty Python and the Holy Grail.</p>
<p>"But choose wisely, for while the true Grail will bring you life, the false Grail will take it from you." ~ Grail Knight, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.</p>
<p>"It begins with the king as a boy, having to spend the night alone in the forest to prove his courage so he can become king. Now while he is spending the night alone he's visited by a sacred vision. Out of the fire appears the Holy Grail, symbol of God's divine grace. And a voice said to the boy, 'You shall be keeper of the grail so that it may heal the hearts of men.' But the boy was blinded by greater visions of a life filled with power and glory and beauty. And in this state of radical amazement he felt for a brief moment not like a boy, but invincible, like God, so he reached into the fire to take the grail, and the grail vanished, leaving him with his hand in the fire to be terribly wounded. Now as this boy grew older, his wound grew deeper. Until one day, life for him lost its reason. He had no faith in any man, not even himself. He couldn't love or feel loved. He was sick with experience. He began to die. One day a fool wandered into the castle and found the king alone. And being a fool, he was simple minded, he didn't see a king. He only saw a man alone and in pain. And he asked the king, 'What ails you friend?' The king replied, 'I'm thirsty. I need some water to cool my throat'. So the fool took a cup from beside his bed, filled it with water and handed it to the king. As the king began to drink, he realized his wound was healed. He looked in his hands and there was the holy grail, that which he sought all of his life. And he turned to the fool and said with amazement, 'How can you find that which my brightest and bravest could not?' And the fool replied, 'I don't know. I only knew that you were thirsty.' It's very beautiful, isn't it?" ~ Parry, The Fisher King.</p>
<p>"Follow your bliss." ~ Joseph Campbell.</p>

<p>There are two separate game modes. Creative and Survival.  If you're mostly interested in making fantastic structures from scratch with unlimited resources, <strong>Creative Mode</strong> is your best bet. However, if you prefer a world of danger, using crafting, building and ingenuity to survive, you'll want to <strong>Enable Damage</strong> and install <a href="https://github.com/tenplus1/mobs">mobs</a>.</p>
<p>Grail_test is a game about placing and digging blocks in a randomly generated 3D world. You move around using the <strong>WASD</strong> keys, <strong>space bar</strong> to jump / swim and <strong>Left Shift</strong> to go down or sneak. The first challenge is to build a house to protect you from nocturnal monsters and stash your treasure.</p>

<p>To get started, find a tree. Click and hold with the left mouse button on the trunk until it breaks. A piece of tree trunk will appear in your inventory (the 'hotbar' at the bottom of the screen is the first row of your inventory). To select different items from the hotbar, use the mouse wheel, or the number keys 1-8. You place blocks by right-clicking.</p>
<p>To open your inventory menu, press the I key on your keyboard. When you open your inventory, you will see a 3x3 box of squares at the top. This is the crafting grid. It is where you make the various items. Press Esc to close it.</p>
<p>Craft planks and sticks then you can make a wooden pick, which will allow you to quarry stone, metal and gems. Once you get some cobble you can make a stone pick. When you have collected some ores you need to cook them in a furnace to turn them into ingots. Ingots can be crafted into tools, armour and other useful stuff. You can cook food in furnaces. You can also make glass from sand and turn cobble back into stone.</p>
<p>You heal hearts by eating things. You can grow crops on hoed ground near a water supply. And you can build whatever you want.</p>
<p>There are some great youtube vids on the basics of minetest.</p>
